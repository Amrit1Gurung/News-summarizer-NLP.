       "      <td>According to insiders, Oli later on Wednesday had urged Gautam not to aspire for the National Assembly and rather prepare to contest an election from any constituency for the House of Representatives..The Secretariat meeting of the ruling Nepal Communist Party scheduled for 11am on Thursday has been postponed until 3pm after the top leadership failed to reach consensus on who to pick as a member of the National Assembly..If Oli has to continue Yubaraj Khatiwada as the finance minister, Khatiwada must be appointed the National Assembly member by Friday, but party vice-chair Bamdev Gautam is also vying for the Upper House seat..As per constitutional provisions, a non-elected person can be appointed a minister but he or she needs to take the oath as a member either of the House of Representatives or the National Assembly within six months of the appointment..If Gautam is to contest for a House of Representatives seat, the ruling party needs to ask one of its lawmakers to resign..Khatiwada was reappointed finance minister on March 4 after his two-year tenure as the National Assembly member expired..Khatiwada will complete his six months as a minister without a membership in any of the two Houses of Parliament on Friday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Two former lawmakers have started an indefinite hunger strike at Garuda in Rautahat district, demanding justice for 19-year-old Bijay Mahara who died after allegedly being tortured by police in custody..However, a video of Bijay, which was taken in hospital prior to his death, shows him saying that he was indeed tortured by plainclothes police and forced to confess to the August 16 murder of 17-year-old Niranjan..Bishwendra Pasawan and Ramprit Paswan have been staging a fast-unto-death strike outside the Area Police Office in Garuda since Tuesday evening, demanding a fair investigation into Bijay’s death..Following widespread protests, the Ministry of Home Affairs on Tuesday suspended Inspector Singh of the District Police Office, Gaur..A source at the Area Police Office in Garuda said that three police officers from the crime branch of the District Police Office had tortured Bijay in custody bypassing an investigation officer designated to probe Niranjan murder case..According to the source, they took Bijay and Sikendra Pasawan, another suspect, to a detention room and forced them to confess to the Niranjan’s murder..A police team led by Deputy Superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato, the then chief at the Area Police Office in Garuda, had then reached the site to collect the body and look for evidence.</td>\n",

       "8   “I do not see any point in ministers and leaders from Kathmandu making rounds of every other disaster-hit areas, as provincial and local governments are already in place to respond to such events” said Khimlal Devkota, an expert on federal affairs who also writes extensively on fiscal federalism..With the three tiers of government in place for the last three years, people’s representatives and the federal government should have worked to devolve power and strengthen sub-national governments, according to analysts..“Provincial and local governments are out of business, so the federal government should make them responsible.” In the past, some provinces have complained about the federal government’s tendency to undermine their authority, but there still seems to be confusion, according to analysts..The federal government is already facing criticism for holding on to the concept of chief district officers and making them work as the Home Ministry’s liaison in the districts even in the current federal set-up..In 2017, people’s representatives were elected in 6,473 wards of 753 local bodies across the country to ensure that everyone has their representation in decision-making and that state through its various arms, like wards, will ensure service delivery, promptly respond in the times of crisis and listen to the people’s plight..While there is a worldwide practice of prime ministers or presidents visiting the places hit by a disaster or crisis of a large scale, such events a...  \n",
