# News-summarizer-NLP.
Newspaper articles is  extracted from the [The kathmandu Post](https://kathmandupost.com/). Only 9 news categories have been  extraced and and each category conatains 20 news articles(today's and last few days news).  
In this repository there are 2 notebooks, one uses **TfidfVectorizer** and another uses pre-trained **Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5** GloVe vectors with **TextRank** algorithmn. The reason for writing 2 notebooks is to compare the results from 2 notebooks.The summary results were almost camparable and precise.
