0,"For some, the pandemic is an opportunity to start new businesses","September 6, 2020","By six every morning, Kinchu Lhamo Bhutia is out of her house to buy chicken and buffalo meat. Buying the meat herself is one of her quality control measures for her business Kinchu’s Kitchen, which sells frozen momos, and buff and chicken pickles. For a long time, Kinchu’s Kitchen was just an idea in Bhutia’s head. Bhutia, a native of Sikkim, moved to Kathmandu after getting married. She had always wanted to start a business focusing on serving the kind of Sikkimese food that she grew up eating. But between helping her husband’s pashmina business in Kathmandu and raising her children, she had very little time to do anything else.  As the nation went into a lockdown in March, the family’s pashmina shop in Thamel had to be shut, and Bhutia found herself free time. On April 16, nearly a month into the lockdown, Bhutia launched Kinchu’s Kitchen. Not long after launching her business, it took off, and since then Kinchu’s Kitchen has sold thousands of plates of momos and hundreds of bottles of meat pickles.  The pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns have crippled businesses across the country. Job losses and pay cuts have become common across industries. However, in these economically turbulent times, some like Bhutia have started online businesses that have taken off.  “Friends who had tried my food have always told me to start my own food business but I never really thought I would actually start it in the midst of a pandemic,” said Bhutia.  Two months after Bhutia started her business, Sushmita Manandhar started her online bakery shop (bakeaway_Nepal), on June 16. Manandhar, a baking enthusiast, has been baking for a decade.  “I used to bake for my family and friends,” said Manandhar. “But ever since I started helping my father with his business, I got too busy to spend much time on baking.”  But that changed during the lockdown. “During the lockdown, our family business had to be shut, and I had ample free time to bake, and I resumed baking and shared my baked products with family, friends, and neighbours,” said Manandhar. “One of my friends insisted that I sell my baked items online, and on June 16, I created an Instagram page bakeaway_Nepal. That’s how my small venture was born.” On July 29, a few days after the nation-wide lockdown was lifted, Yasodha Tamang started Cheli Ko Chulo, an online momo venture. For Tamang, a teacher by profession, cooking has always been her way of expressing her love for family and friends.  “During the lockdown my brother and I toyed with the idea of commercialising my passion for cooking,” said Tamang. “And what better way than to start with momos. Before we started Cheli Ko Chulo, we sent our momos to our friends and loved ones and told them to give us their honest feedback. The feedback was very positive, which was very encouraging.”  But when Manandhar, Tamang, and Bhutia started their businesses, they didn’t expect to see success as quickly as they have. The trio’s clientele in the initial days were mainly made up of friends and families. “When I began receiving orders from strangers, that was when I realised the true potential of the business,” said Manandhar. For Tamang and Bhutia, it was when their friends became repeat customers that they knew their business was going to do well. “I sell an average of 40 plates of momos a day,” said Tamang. On average, Bhutia sells 50 plates of momos and 30 bottles of pickles a day.  Manandhar gets an average of five to six orders a day for cakes, muffins and cupcakes, and in a week she gets an average of six birthday cake orders.  “For the first few weeks after launch, I only did pick-up services. But when the orders started increasing, I realised having home delivery services makes things much more convenient for customers,” said Manandhar. “I then got in touch with a delivery company and started availing their services from July 6.”",National,https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/06/for-some-the-pandemic-is-an-opportunity-to-start-new-businesses
1,Smugglers in Dadeldhura haphazardly fell trees on pretext of constructing road,"September 6, 2020","Hundreds of trees have been felled down on the pretext of constructing a ring road in the Chure forest area of Aalital Rural Municipality in Dadeldhura. The incident came to light on August 22 when forest officials confiscated a large quantity of green sal logs on the road section that connects Godam bazaar in Aalital to Dola Village. The trees were felled down on the pretext of connecting Dola Village to the ring road, locals say.  On August 25, a team from the Finance, Development and Natural Resource Committee in Sudurpaschim Province had gone to inspect Rajani Community Forest and its vicinity. Purna Joshi, a provincial assembly member and also a member of the committee, said, “During inspection, we found that the road was dug with an objective to cut down trees. There’s no need for a road in that area where the trees were felled.”  In the last fiscal year, a budget of Rs 14.5 million was allocated to construct a six-kilometre road section to connect Dola Village to the ring road. Of the total budget, Ugratara Construction, the contractor company, had agreed to construct the road for Rs 7.7 million.  “Trees of Rajani Community Forest and the national forest adjacent to the community forest were felled haphazardly on the pretext of constructing the road,” said Ram Bahadur Kunwar, a local of Godam bazaar. “We had informed the Sub Division Office about the haphazard tree felling but the forest employees did not pay any heed.” According to the Division Forest Office in Dadeldhura, forest officials also found sal logs hidden inside the houses of consumers four days ago.  “There are more sal logs concealed in the forest area,” said Hari Singh Bohara, a resident of Aalital.  Locals said they cannot openly talk about the smugglers and timber smuggling in the forest because of an incident in which an individual, who provided information to the media about timber smuggling, was burnt alive by smugglers a decade ago. A year ago, a journalist who exposed timber smuggling in Dadeldhura was also given death threats by smugglers.  “Smugglers, in collusion with forest officials and local political leaders, have been smuggling timber from the Aalital area for a long time. This is why we cannot openly talk about them,” said Bohara.  However, Santosh Bhatta, chief at the Aalital Sub Division Forest Office, claims he does not know about the tree felling incident in the forest. “For the time being, the sub division office is focused on controlling smuggling of logs along the border area of Kailali and Dadeldhura,” Bhatta said. “The spokesperson at the Division Forest Office in Dadeldhura will provide additional information about the tree felling in Rajani Community Forest and its vicinity.”  Meanwhile, Bishnu Acharya, chief at the Dadeldhura Forest Office, said, “We found that a large number of trees were felled down in collusion with forest employees in Aalital. But we don’t know the exact number of felled trees. Forest officials are collecting details on the incident.”  According to Acharya, two individuals, including the chairman of the Rajani Community Forest, have been arrested to make inquiries about the incident on August 24.  In the meantime, the road construction work in Aalital continues despite the area receiving massive rainfalls just a month ago.

2,Around 40 percent government staff haven’t received their salaries yet,"September 6, 2020","The Rautahat District Treasury Comptroller’s Office has not released the salaries of provincial staffers based in the district for Shrawan (mid-July-mid-August). Normally, it would release the salaries a week in advance so that money can be distributed to the staff at the end of the month. “As provincial government offices have not submitted their financial details for the 2019-20 fiscal, which ended two months ago, and the payment orders seeking funds for the salaries, not a single penny has been released as salary as of Friday,” said Ishwori Prasad Dhakal, chief of District Treasury Comptroller Office, Rautahat.  For staffers at a government office to receive salaries, the office chief and chief accountant need to sign a payment order requesting the district treasury office to release funds. But, according to Dhakal, office chiefs and chief accountants in many offices haven’t gone to work due to restrictions imposed by the local administration to contain the spread of Covid-19. “As a result, provincial staffers haven’t received their pay for Shrawan,” he said.  District treasury offices fall under the jurisdiction of the Financial Comptroller General’s Office, which keeps track of the government’s income and expenditure. There are several provincial-level offices in Rautahat, including those related to irrigation, forest, agriculture and veterinary services. It’s not just the provincial staffers in Rauthat who haven’t received their pay. Around 40 percent of government employees at both the federal and provincial levels across the country haven’t received the salary for Shrawan, according to the Financial Comptroller General’s Office. “The district treasury offices have released funds for the salaries of only 60 percent of government employees so far,” said Deputy Financial Comptroller General Bhesh Prasad Bhurtel. Even Kathmandu-based district treasury offices have not released the salaries of all staffers.  “For example, the district treasury office in Singh Durbar has released the salaries of around 90 of the 100 offices under its ambit and the one in Teku has released the salaries of around 80 of the 87 offices it deals with,” said Bhurtel. Usually, the district treasury offices start releasing funds for salaries weeks before the end of the month based on financial details submitted by the concerned government offices.  But, due to the coronavirus pandemic, local administration offices have enforced prohibitory orders in more than half of the 77 districts. “In order to prepare the payment order, the office chief and the chief accountant need to sign the document. But, the situation is that in some offices the chief can’t attend office while in others the chief accountant remains absent,” said Bhurtel. In the case of Rautahat, provincial offices in the district are yet to submit their financial details for the last fiscal (2019-20). Submission of such details is a prerequisite for the disbursement of salaries in the new fiscal. Likewise, relevant offices should also issue payment orders based on the attendance data of the staffers. Dhakal said that his office has, however, released the salaries of the army and police personnel and court staffers in the district. This district, along with other districts of Province 2, have been severely affected by Covid-19.

3,Relief distribution programme in Birgunj fails to cover vulnerable families,"September 6, 2020","On Thursday, many residents of Ranighat in Birgunj Metropolis reached the District Police Office in Parsa to receive relief after hearing about the police office’s distribution programme through a local FM station. Among them was 50-year-old Nagma Khatun, who had been visiting the office for the past two days in hopes of receiving relief.  “We came to the police office after hearing that they were distributing relief,” said Khatun. “We were here on Wednesday too but our turn never came. They asked us to come back on Thursday but after waiting all day long, they turned us away empty-handed.”  More than 150 women from Sheerpur, Murli and Chhapaiya in Birgunj queued up outside the police office for two days to receive relief. However, most of them had to return empty-handed after security personnel from the police office asked them to leave.  “They told us that it was the metropolis who was supposed to distribute relief,” said Khatun. “But the metropolis is currently not distributing relief so we came here.” The nationwide lockdown that was put in place back in March followed by the protracted prohibitory order imposed by the metropolis for over a month now have left many daily-wage earners and those from the lower-income bracket without a source of income. These families are solely dependent on relief provided by the government to see them through these tough times.  Girija Devi, who is in her early 40’s, has a family of four to feed. A resident of Ranighat in Birgunj Metropolis-11, Devi says her family has been robbed of the opportunity to work since the prohibitory order was imposed in the metropolis on July 25 to control the spread of Covid-19.  “We are daily wage workers. We cannot work when there are lockdown and prohibitory orders in place,” she said. “It’s becoming increasingly difficult for us to survive.”  According to the District Police Office, the relief distribution programme was meant for those in extremely vulnerable situations. The office had collected data of the needy families in the metropolis but on Thursday those whose names were not listed had also reached the police office.  “The District Police Office had decided to distribute leftover foodstuff from an earlier distribution drive to around 60 people. The local unit was to provide relief to another 80,” said Superintendent of Police Ganga Panta. “But on Thursday, a large crowd gathered outside the office so we had to send them away.”  The women who had reached the police office on Thursday claimed that security personnel resorted to baton charge to disperse the crowd.  “They called us to the office but chased us away by using force. This is adding insult to our injury,"" said Tetar Devi Paswan of Chhapkaiya, who had also reached the police office on Thursday. The police, however, deny allegations of using force on the crowd. Meanwhile, in Ward No.19 of the metropolis, food grains meant for 200 impoverished families have been stuck in the storeroom of Bindabasini temple for the last two months. The Province 2 government had sent the relief packages for needy families back in June. Each package comprises 25 kg rice, two kg lentil, one litre cooking oil and one packet salt. The locals blame Santosh Tiwari, the ward chairman who is also the spokesperson at the metropolis, for depriving them of relief materials sent by the provincial government.  ""We had repeatedly requested the ward chairman to distribute the relief but he ignored us,"" said Naresh Prasad Gupta, a local.  Tiwari, however, claimed that the relief distribution was delayed, as the available relief materials were not enough for every needy family in the ward.  “The amount we have with us right now is not sufficient for all needy families. We will bring more stuff and distribute it among the locals in the next few days,” said Tiwari. Hundreds of impoverished families in Birgunj have been left high and dry for almost six months now since the nationwide lockdown was imposed following the coronavirus pandemic. Nasima Khatun of Shreepur used to work as a house help but she hasn’t been able to work amid the pandemic. Her husband, a teacher, has also not received his monthly salary for the past four months.  “This pandemic has rendered us both jobless. We have used up most of our savings and if the government does not provide us with food, we will die of hunger soon,” she said.  Khatun had also reached the police office on Thursday to receive relief but was sent away since her name was not on the list of needy people prepared by the police office.  “I came to the police office hoping to get relief but they chased me away. They said they were giving relief only to those whose names were on the list and that we should go to the metropolis’ office. But the metropolis is not distributing any relief,"" she said.  Meanwhile, Chief District Officer of Parsa Asman Tamang said the district administration had started distributing reliefs to impoverished families through the District Police Office and Birgunj Metropolis since the past few days.

4,Job schemes come into question as virus-induced unemployment hits rural youths hard,"September 6, 2020","Last week, when a group of Nepalis were crossing the Gaurifanta border in Kailali, Dinesh BK was among them. BK from Rukum was en route to India for work. The 24-year-old from Rukum said he was preparing for a civil service job. But since the Public Service Commission examinations have been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he said he chose to go to Himachal Pradesh in India to work in apple orchards. Many Nepalis from the region have for years been working in the apple orchards in the Indian state.  BK said he lost his job in marketing in Surkhet, where he was also preparing for the Public Service Commission examinations. “Since then I had been home doing nothing,” said BK. “When I heard that friends from my village were planning to go to Shimla to pick apples, I decided to join them.” Everyone in BK’s group was below 30 years of age and have been studying in different cities of western Nepal.  Experts say the government plans to employ the youths at home would have worked better, had they been implemented well. According to Ganesh Gurung, a labour and migration expert, if the various government schemes ensured opportunities at home, youths like BK would have stayed back.  “Those going back to India are among the poorest of the poor. First, workers from India returned home in the wake of the pandemic. Now, they are going back as there is no work here,” said Gurung, who is also a former member of the National Planning Commission. “Leaving behind their families and going back to India as the infections are increasing by the day is like going to war.”  While Covid-19 cases are rising in Nepal at an alarming rate, India has become one of the top countries to have the highest number of infections. The number of coronavirus cases in India as of Saturday stands at 4,103,694, with more than 80,000 daily new cases reported over the last few days.  The Oli government’s flagship programme to create jobs at home–Prime Minister Employment Programme—seems to be not working, analysts say. As part of the programme, the government aimed to create jobs for 200,000 people at the local level in this fiscal year.  But there are no jobs at the local level. Such a desperate situation indicates that government programmes that promised jobs, even for a temporary period, have not reached targeted groups, according to Gurung.  “This is a systematic failure when Singh Durbar says they are sending a budget, but it’s not reaching the people,” Gurung told the Post. “That Nepalis are still migrating to India and also seeking labour permits for the Gulf only shows these schemes have not changed much for the groups that need jobs.”  Two years into its implementation, the Prime Minister Employment Programme, which promises a minimum 100 days of employment for unemployed registered citizens, have not shown promising results.  The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security says that the programme generated employment opportunities for its target of 60,ooo people across the country in the fiscal year 2019-20.  But it has not met its target of a minimum providing 100 days of work a year for the target population. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, a former labour secretary, said the programme, despite promising a minimum 100 days of employment, has not been able to provide jobs for 50 days .  The challenge has got even bigger with the return of Nepali workers from India and other labour destination countries.  As of now, more than 56,000 Nepalis have returned home by air, whereas an estimated 300,000-400,000 have returned to Sudurpaschim Province alone from India. Karnali Province, from where BK is, and Sudurpaschim Province have the highest number of people who go to Indian cities in search of work.  Suman Ghimire, the national director of the Prime Minister Employment Programme, admits that Covid-19 has added to the challenge of job creation in the country.  “We are coordinating with stakeholders for internal job creation and discussing potential sectors,” said Ghimire. “But the programme cannot cover everyone. The programme priorities those who are from highly marginalised groups even among unemployed sections.” According to Ghimire, funds are being sent first to the local level this year, and they have been asked to update the number of registered unemployed citizens.  After Covid-19 rattled the world’s economy, leading to massive job losses for Nepali workers at home and abroad, the Nepal government has pledged to create more than 700,000 jobs in the current fiscal year to provide employment to those affected by the pandemic.  Despite past failures and severe criticisms, the government has doubled its budget for the employment programme to Rs 11.6 billion this fiscal year from Rs 5.o1 billion in the fiscal year 2018-19. Besides, the Labour Ministry has also received a soft loan of approximately Rs14 billion from the World Bank to implement the Youth Employment Transformation Initiative Project, a five-year project, under the employment programme.  This year the project has aimed to create 75,000 jobs for unemployed youths, primarily women.  “With the increase in the number of unemployed, local units have been asked to come up with programmes where more people could be employed,” said Ghimire. “They will come up with projects under the programme after the Labour Ministry sets criteria for them. We will also make sure that those working under the employment scheme are immediately paid.” According to Bhattarai, the employment scheme itself is not a complete employment programme. But it can be useful for part-time job seekers and those migrant workers who are at home during vacation, he said.  “This nationwide programme can just be a supporting employment scheme, for example, for a farmer or someone who is free for a short duration,” Bhattarai told the Post. “We need to understand that this programme is only a kind of a social security initiative.” But even the little social security it was supposed to provide has not been beneficial to unemployed citizens and they are forced to migrate even during the time of this pandemic.  “The Prime Minister Employment Programme should have at least provided short-term jobs and discouraged such seasonal migration,” said Gurung. “But there is no visible result, as people continue to migrate for basic needs.”  Rather than providing seasonal employment, the Prime Minister Employment Programme should focus on asset-building by developing skills, along with providing jobs, according to Bhattarai.  “The programme should be implemented in such a way that it promotes other economic activities at the local level and upgrades skills of those involved,” said Bhattarai. “Local units that implement the scheme should be strengthened. They should be communicated about the long-term benefits of developing skills rather than simply providing temporary jobs.” Besides the presently unemployed, an estimated 500,000 labour force enters the labour market every year. With tens of thousands expected to return from abroad, the need to create jobs is huge.  The International Labour Organisation has estimated nearly 2million jobs have been affected in Nepal and an estimated 500,000 are expected to return home from abroad.

5,Police suspect illegal gambling dens are thriving during Covid-19 restrictions,"September 5, 2020","Every year, Nepal Police crack down on hundreds of illegal gambling dens which are operated mostly in private houses across the country and confiscate millions of rupees. But during the coronavirus pandemic, not many raids have been conducted as the majority of security personnel are busy enforcing restrictions. The number of arrests on illegal gambling charges has gone down as a result, say police who suspect that illegal gambling dens have thrived during these past six months of Covid-19 lockdown and restrictions. According to the data provided by Metropolitan Police Office, Ranipokhari a total of 22 people were rounded up from illegal gambling joints in Kathmandu Valley in the last six months.  “We have not conducted that many raids in private houses in the past six months, as our personnel are busy due enforcing Covid-19 restrictions,” said Senior Superintendent of Police, Sushil Kumar Yadav, spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Office, Ranipokhari.  Police have been conducting raids based on tip-offs while they have halted their own anti-gambling crackdown.  On Saturday, a team from the Metropolitan Police Circle, Boudha, raided the house of Dawa Sherpa, 36, of Kathmandu Metropolitan-6, Boudha, following a tip-off. The team detained a dozen gamblers and confiscated around Rs 300,000 from them. According to the Gambling Act 1963, if one is caught for gambling offence for the first time, they shall be liable to a fine not exceeding Rs 200. For repeat offenders, there is a provision of jail sentences ranging from one month to a whole year. As many places across the country are in lockdown and the festival season around the corner, many private homes are becoming gambling dens, said Yadav. The law enforcement authority believes that gambling leads to social crimes and violence. Police have urged the public to immediately report gambling activities. “The country’s law bars Nepali citizens from entering casinos with the intent of gambling, while hotels and restaurants are closed due to restriction due to which private houses become the dens for gamblers. So without getting a tip-off from family members or neighbours about it, raiding is difficult,” said Yadav. According to the data maintained by the Metropolitan Police Office, Rani Pokhari, more than Rs 19 million was recovered from 1,161 suspected gamblers from different parts of the Valley in the fiscal year 2018/19. “The money seized from the gamblers goes to the government's funds,” said Yadav. According to the data of the past three fiscal years, the number of people arrested for gambling offences has risen steadily. In the fiscal year 2018/19, police detained 2,869 people, the highest number of arrests in the past three years, from across the country. Nearly 40 percent (1,161) of the arrest was made in Kathmandu Valley.",National,https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/05/police-suspect-illegal-gamblings-dens-are-thriving-during-covid-19-restrictions
6,Overstay fines become a hurdle for Nepali workers waiting to return home from the UAE,"September 5, 2020","After months of wait, Khem, a Nepali migrant worker in Dubai, managed to get a flight ticket to return home.  But in the last three weeks, his flight has been rescheduled several times.  “I managed to buy the ticket with some contribution from my employer and loan from my family back home. But here I am still, counting my days to return,” Khem told the Post from Dubai over the phone.  Having gone through a series of flight rescheduling, Khem is uncertain when—or whether—he will reach home. Khem, who hails from Jhapa, is particularly worried after witnessing what happened to his three friends, whom he had gone to see off at Dubai airport last Monday. “My three friends could not board their flight because they could not pay the overstay fines,” Khem said. “They requested the officials to allow them to board the flight, but nothing happened.”  The Nepal Airlines flight took off, leaving behind at least 17 workers at Dubai airport.Khem said even when the flights are available, many Nepali workers are unable to return home because of hefty overstay fines.  Many workers do not have the money to pay the fines. Their money has been spent on air tickets, which are already several times expensive. The UAE government’s ongoing amnesty programme for foreigners, including Nepali migrants, have given a three-month grace period to the foreigners whose visa expired before March 1, meaning they have until November to return to their countries without facing any punishments or fines for overstaying their visas. There are many Nepali workers in the UAE, including Khem and his three friends, whose visas expired after the March 1 cutoff date and now face overstay fines and thereby unable to return home unless they pay the fines. These workers could not return home soon after their visa had expired because there were no flights to bring them home.  “I managed to get a ticket and I have borrowed money from my friends to pay for the PCR test. But I have no idea how I am going to pay around 1,200 UAE Dirhams (approximately Rs38,243) as an overstay fine,” said Khem.  He fears he will be stranded without food and accommodation.  According to Pasang Sherpa, vice-chairman of Non-Resident Nepalese Association (NRNA), UAE chapter, overstay fines are being charged only to those workers boarding their flights via Dubai airport as different emirates have different rules. “The rule applies to all foreigners, so even the embassy cannot do much in this regard,” Sherpa told the Post. “The only solution to this problem is that either the Nepal government should pay the fines or make the employers pay.”  Sherpa said this situation would not have arrived had the Nepal government agreed to the UAE government’s proposal of flying the Nepali workers to Kathmandu for free of cost. “The UAE government had approached the Nepal government about sending back Nepali workers on free flights, but the Nepal government did not even give the landing permission,” Sherpa said. Over 35,000 Nepali migrants have registered with the Nepal embassy in Abu Dhabi to return home. Nepal government’s failure to address the plights of undocumented workers have put hundreds of workers without work and valid visas in trouble.  According to Som Prasad Lamichhane, director with the Pravasi Nepali Coordination Committee, an organisation working for the rights of Nepali migrant workers, Nepal government could have taken a diplomatic initiative to waive off the overstay fines of migrant workers. “We have not seen diplomatic dialogue with the host nations to help the Nepali workers,” said Lamichhane. “The government could have at least requested for the general amnesty for workers whose visas have expired and could not travel home because of the lockdown.” Khem and his three friends have a rescheduled flight on Sunday. They don’t know whether they will be allowed to board the plane with unpaid overstay fines. ",National,https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/05/overstay-fines-become-a-hurdle-for-nepali-workers-waiting-to-return-home-from-the-uae
7,Repatriation quandary persists even with funds to support migrant workers’ airfare,"September 5, 2020","The Supreme Court on June 15 ordered the government to repatriate the Nepali migrant workers stranded in various labour destinations by using the Foreign Employment Welfare Fund. It’s been more than two and half months since the court decision, and the government has still not provided the air tickets to the Nepali workers languishing in foreign countries. Many workers have been without jobs and money to support themselves for months now due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Following the Supreme Court’s directive, it took nearly a month for the government to approve the migrant workers’ repatriation guidelines. Now, nearly one and a half months later, it still remains unclear when the migrant workers will return home.  Din Bandhu Subedi, spokesperson for the Foreign Employment Board, which manages the welfare fund, said the board had released Rs 4 million to the Nepal Embassy in Malaysia to send back 86 stranded workers. “But we are not yet sure whether those workers have already returned to Nepal or not. Other embassies have also been collecting details of the workers who need to be repatriated,” he told the Post. “For instance, the Nepal Embassy in the United Arab of Emirates has estimated that 15,000 Nepali workers may need the welfare fund’s support to return home.” The government has been facing criticism for the delay in repatriation of troubled migrant workers.  Shom Prasad Luitel, lawyer who had filed the petition at the Supreme Court for repatriation of Nepali migrant workers, says the government and its embassies in labour hosting countries are not committed to the task of repatriating the stranded citizens.  “I think the government wants the workers to return with their own wherewithal and reimburse them later,” said Luitel.  The guidelines state that the concerned recruiting agencies and foreign missions must first ensure the migrant workers have not received air tickets or other financial aid from their employers or host nations before they get support from the welfare fund to return home. Some have argued that the guidelines are complicated, thus delaying the repatriation process.“Even some ambassadors have expressed dissatisfaction on the guidelines,” said Sharu Joshi Shrestha, a gender and migration expert. “Lack of coordination among concerned stakeholders, which was missing while drafting of the guidelines, has affected the overall repatriation process.”  But Luitel disagrees. He argues the guidelines simply instruct the Nepali missions to contact the employers, recruiting agencies, or the host governments and check if the workers are getting any financial support for airfare so that they could return home.  “For years, the Nepali missions in labour destination countries have been taking the grievances of workers to the employers, recruiting agencies and host governments. The repatriation guidelines also instruct them to do the same. Only this time they are supposed to make sure whether the workers have received airfare support,” said Luitel, who was also a member of the committee that drafted the guidelines.",National,https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/05/repatriation-quandary-persists-even-with-funds-to-support-migrant-workers-airfare
8,How politicians' chopper rides to disaster-hit areas fly in the face of spirit of federalism,"September 5, 2020","On Thursday, an image of Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa was widely circulated on social media. The image was taken moments before he boarded a Nepali Army chopper to visit a flood-hit area in Baglung district. Bad weather, however, cancelled his planned trip. Thapa returned to Kathmandu without visiting Baglung. Earlier in the third week of August, Home Minister Thapa, along with senior Nepal Communist Party leader Bhim Rawal, visited Sainibazaar of Achham district to distribute relief materials to flood-hit locals. Thapa and Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota also flew to Sindhupalchok when landslides hit the Lidi village last month. According to a report in Kantipur, the Post’s sister paper, Thapa and Sapkota over the last three weeks have visited various districts “to inspect” flood- and landslide-hit areas and to distribute relief. The Kantipur report suggests around Rs3.5 million has been spent from the state coffers for chartering the Army’s MI-17 helicopter. What is more concerning than the money spent on such inspection visits is politicians in Kathmandu are continuing the practice that was prevalent in the Panchayat days, analysts say. Even after practicing multi-party democracy for decades and then the federal democratic system for the last three years, the mindset of the politicians has not changed yet according to them. “I do not see any point in ministers and leaders from Kathmandu making rounds of every other disaster-hit areas, as provincial and local governments are already in place to respond to such events” said Khimlal Devkota, an expert on federal affairs who also writes extensively on fiscal federalism.  At the federal level there are three different disaster management bodies in place — the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management National Council headed by prime minister, the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Executive Committee headed by Home Minister and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority under the Home Ministry—and the 77 district disaster management committees led by the respective chief district officers.  The Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act 2017 also envisions Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Provincial Council, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Provincial Executive Committee in each of the seven provinces and local disaster management committees in the 753 local governments.  Every provincial government also has its own internal affairs ministry. While there is a worldwide practice of prime ministers or presidents visiting the places hit by a disaster or crisis of a large scale, such events are largely meant to instill the feeling into the citizens that the state is there to support them.  But the way the ministers and politicians from Kathmandu race to visit the disaster-hit sites and distribute relief shows their efforts are just perfunctory, analysts say. “I do not think our leaders have internalised federalism in true sense,” said Hari Roka, a political economist. “They hardly give a thought to what they should do and what they should not so as to help strengthen federalism. Such visits are largely guided by their desire to display their power and accumulate more power. They just want to centralise authority, which is against the spirit of the federal system.” After decades of political upheaval, Nepal adopted a new constitution through the Constituent Assembly, a primary demand of the Maoist party that waged the decade-long war against the state. The Maoist leaders said the unitary system of governance and the monarchy were the major hurdle in the country’s socio-political transformation. Around 13,000 people died and hundreds disappeared during the decade-long war that the Maoists fought to transform Nepal into a federal democratic republic.  After the 2015 constitution ensured Nepal as a federal democratic republic, elections held in 2017 installed three tiers of government across the country–a federal government in Kathmandu, seven provincial governments and 753 local governments. The biggest bane of the unitary system, according to the proponents of the federal system, was people at the grassroots were always on the margins, as the state largely failed to reach out to them.  Thapa, the current home minister, is among the senior Maoist leaders who said they fought to transform Nepal into a federal state. In 2017, people’s representatives were elected in 6,473 wards of 753 local bodies across the country to ensure that everyone has their representation in decision-making and that state through its various arms, like wards, will ensure service delivery, promptly respond in the times of crisis and listen to the people’s plight.  With the three tiers of government in place for the last three years, people’s representatives and the federal government should have worked to devolve power and strengthen sub-national governments, according to analysts. “But politicians in Kathmandu want to centralise power and authority. This shows they want to paralyse federalism,” said Roka. “It is explicitly written in the constitution that the job of the federal government is to facilitate the two tiers of governments and empower them, guide them through the proper policy, among others.” According to Roka, if a sub-national government lacks funds or resources, the federal government should provide them with resources. “It cannot interfere,” Roka told the Post. The federal government is already facing criticism for holding on to the concept of chief district officers and making them work as the Home Ministry’s liaison in the districts even in the current federal set-up. Chief district officers’ role has been criticised for undermining the sub-national governments, as they report to the Home Ministry in Kathmandu instead of the provincial internal affairs ministry. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli himself has on more than one occasion defied the concept of federalism, saying the sub-national governments are agencies under the federal government and that they are not independent entities. This despite the constitution vesting explicit powers to provincial and local governments to function. Experts say rescue and relief efforts when a disaster strikes any part of the country require coordinated efforts from all levels of the government. “The federal government should coordinate with the local governments for rescue and relief efforts,” said Devkota, the expert on federal affairs. “Provincial and local governments are out of business, so the federal government should make them responsible.” In the past, some provinces have complained about the federal government’s tendency to undermine their authority, but there still seems to be confusion, according to analysts. Shanta Raj Subedi, a former finance secretary, said that since there is no alternative to federalism, the government has to create bases for fiscal federalism, resources distribution and decentralisation of various resources and it should be done soon rather than later.",National,https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/05/how-politicians-chopper-rides-to-disaster-hit-areas-flies-in-the-face-of-spirit-of-federalism
9,Race begins for new finance minister as Oli bids farewell to Khatiwada,"September 4, 2020","Yubaraj Khatiwada resigned as finance and information and communication technology minister on Friday, a day after the ruling Nepal Communist Party decided not to nominate him, again, as a member of the National Assembly, a prerequisite for him to continue in the Oli Cabinet. While two ministerial berths are vacant after Khatiwada’s resignation, all eyes are now on who succeeds him in the Finance Ministry. Since another ministry is also vacant, now a Cabinet reshuffle is also likely, according to a leader close to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.  “The prime minister has not indicated anything regarding Khatiwada’s replacement yet,” the leader told the Post.  Khatiwada had to resign after the ruling party decided to nominate its vice-chair to the National Assembly. There is only one seat vacant in the National Assembly. Gautam himself has made public his ambitions to become a minister, but it is not clear if Oli will let him lead the Finance Ministry. Oli later on Friday approved Khaitwada’s resignation and decided to keep both the finance and communication and information portfolios with him. At least half a dozen names are currently making rounds for the Finance Ministry. Apart from Gautam, Bishnu Poudel, Surendra Pandey, Janardan Sharma and Barsha Man Pun, who is currently the energy minister, are said to be the top contenders. Poudel, Pandey and Pun have held the finance portfolio in the past.  Insiders say even Pradeep Gyawali, the foreign minister in the Oli Cabinet, could be one of the frontrunners to lead the Finance Ministry. Another leader said that both the ministries led by Khatiwada could be given to Gyawali. If Gyawali is moved to the Finance Ministry, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the spokesperson for the Nepal Communist Party, could be given the Foreign Ministry. Shrestha was appointed a National Assembly member back in January. Both Shrestha and Gautam had lost the 2017 parliamentary elections from Gorkha and Bardiya, respectively. “It’s up to the party; I have not yet staked claim to any ministerial berth. Nor have I expressed my desire to become a minister before any party committees,” Shrestha told the Post. Insiders, however, say after the party went through a tough time in recent months–at one point reaching on the verge of a split–as part of a larger power-sharing deal both Shrestha and Gautam could be appointed ministers. The party was until a few months ago vertically divided between factions led by Oli and the other chair, Pushpa Kamal Dahal. The Dahal faction, backed by senior leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal, had piled pressure on Oli to resign both as party chair and prime minister. With Gautam too on Dahal’s side, Oli was in the minority in the nine-member Secretariat.  Oli, however, managed to bring Gautam back into his fold. Refusal to comply with Guatam’s demand that he be appointed a National Assembly member could have weakened Oli in the party, according to insiders. In a bid to resolve the internal disputes, chairs Oli and Dahal had formed a task force, whose report is yet to be discussed and endorsed by the Standing Committee. The task force has recommended, among others, Oli lead the government for the full five-year term and Dahal run the party with an “expanded role”.  Leaders from the Dahal-Nepal faction said the Oli himself proposed Gautam for the Upper House as soon as the Secretariat meeting began on Thursday, sensing that annoying Gautam could push him into the minority. “Its political meaning is that Oli did not want to show that he is in a minority as Bishnu Poudel won’t go against Gautam,” said a Standing Committee member close to Madhav Nepal. “Oli did not want to change the power equation in the Secretariat at this time.” A leader close to Oli, however, said the decision was expected. “It had become obvious that the prime minister would bid farewell to the finance and communication minister, which he did today,” said Subash Nembang, a Standing Committee member who is a close confidante of Oli. “A Cabinet reshuffle may happen, but only after the Standing Committee endorses the report prepared by the six-member task force.”",National,https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/04/race-begins-for-new-finance-minister-as-oli-bids-farewell-to-khatiwada
10,"The good, bad and ugly of Yubaraj Khatiwada","September 4, 2020","Despite his desire to continue Yubaraj Khaitwada as the finance minister, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, under pressure amid the fluid internal dynamics in his Nepal Communist Party, had to bid farewell to the technocrat.  Oli had handed over one of the key ministries to Khatiwada on February 26, 2018, in a move that earned praises for him, for the technocrat minister had an illustrious background–he holds a PhD in monetary economics, he served twice in the National Planning Commission as vice-chair and once as governor of the Nepal Rastra Bank.  Khatiwada was believed to be Oli’s charioteer–who could drive the government’s “prosperous Nepal, happy Nepali” campaign in the right direction. Economist Govinda Nepal, a former member of National Planning Commission, said Khatiwada’s performance as the finance minister was neither great nor poor.  “During his tenure, the government received a significant amount of foreign aid. There can be a debate whether foreign aid is good or bad, but he managed to get it,” Nepal told the Post. “He was also able to generate enough resources for under-construction projects.” According to Nepal, he should also be lauded for his effort to control tax evasion by introducing a policy of recognising only those transaction details submitted to the tax authority while applying for bank loans.  Khaitwada, therefore, could never earn the trust of the private sector, Nepal said. “He faces charges of not being accommodative, as any other finance minister with a political background could have been,” said Nepal. In the initial days of Khatiwada’s appointment as the finance minister, there certainly were high hopes all around, as he is known as a person well-versed on economy, finance and development issues, according to businesspersons and economists. His past experience as governor and vice-chair of the planning commission meant he knew the sources of ills that mired the country’s economy in stagnation. However, the first criticism he faced was when he brought the white paper on Nepal’s economy, even when the fiscal budget was just round the corner. While painting a bleak picture of the country’s economy, he blamed the past governments for the fiascos.  But he himself failed to do anything substantial to give an impetus to the economy, according to a former administrator who did not want to be named.  “He failed to earn the trust of the market, particularly of the private sector and foreign investors,” said a former government official with a long experience in finance, economy and revenue issues. “He was reluctant to heed the private sector’s concerns, even refusing to meet them on many occasions.” Khatiwada’s contempt for the private sector was well known, and his penchant for imposing state control had left businesspersons worried. Many saw Khatiwada as a rigid bureaucrat, who would not give two hoots about the economic concerns of the private sector, and in the meantime, as also someone who would not hesitate to favour certain individuals or businesspersons. The third budget he presented on May 28 this year especially ran into controversy for some of his policies, and among them, at least two starkly stand out. He increased tax on electric vehicles up to 80 percent, inviting massive criticism from environmentalists.  Another issue was related to the tax on chocolates.  Critics say the move to reduce customs on chocolates was aimed at benefiting certain firms.  Khatiwada even tried to defend the decision at the House of Representatives, saying his decision to limit the customs rate on chocolates to 30 percent was not “not influenced by anyone”. Khatiwada was also known as a strict taxman. From the early months of his appointment, he started to instruct customs officials to increase the valuation of imported goods, which businessmen say was against the principle of valuation of the GATS principles as provisioned in the Customs Act. “Yes, he gradually made his name more as a taxman rather than a finance minister in his little over two years of tenure,” said an industrialist. “His increasing focus on tax had left many spooked.” According to the industrialist, he instructed officials not to recognise the invoice price. The valuation of the reference price maintained by customs offices to ensure that the importers don’t undervalue the imported goods to pay less tax. This is one of the reasons why book importers stopped importing books that had price tags in US dollars.  Despite severe criticism Khatiwada was facing after the latest budget, Oli was for giving continuation to him, as he was expecting Khatiwada to use his good office to bring in investment and aid, which are needed the most in the wake of the pandemic.  Working in the capacity of the central bank governor and vice-chair of the planning commission, Khatiwada had built a good rapport with donor agencies like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.  “It’s true that he has good relations with the donors,” said the former government official. “He was able to bring good foreign aid, particularly from the World Bank during his tenure.” A former finance minister described Khatiwada’s appointment as the finance minister as all sizzle and no steak. “As a professional on economic issues, there were high hopes that the economy would take a leap under his leadership,” said Ram Sharan Mahat, a six-time finance minister who is known for introducing economic liberalisation in Nepal in the early 1990s. “But he made tall promises. There was no way the government could have implemented them.” Mahat, a Nepali Congress leader, took umbrage at Khatiwada’s attempt to discredit the past government [led by Congress party] when he issued the white paper, days after assuming office..  “The administrative expenditure has increased massively while capital expenditure has been just 23-24 percent,” said Mahat. “He wrongly boasted about the current government’s performance in the current fiscal years’ budget.” One criticism Khatiwada faced was data manipulation and multiple people familiar with him the Post talked to said he has that uncanny art. Last year, the Financial Comptroller General Office showed a sudden rise in capital expenditure at the end of the fiscal year 2018-19 after a week-long disruption on its website.  “Forget the general public, even officials did not have access to revenue and expenditure data,” an official from the Financial Comptroller General Office had told the Post.  After revising the revenue and expenditure targets, the Finance Ministry had started to show progress based on the revised targets to show good progress in revenue and expenditure. “Data manipulation began with the white paper [that he issued] which continued later as well,” said the ex-administrator. One of the criticisms Khatiwada will continue to face for a long time is his contempt for the private sector, which is considered the engine for economic growth. “He was known as a person who is not friendly to the private sector since he was the central bank governor,” said the industrialist. “And he behaved the same way with the private sector even after becoming the finance minister.” The private sector had one particular gripe about Khatiwada that he painted all the businesses with the same brush in the name of taking a tough approach against revenue leakages and illicit business practices. According to the industrialist, as someone who has a long experience as vice-chair of the planning commission and governor of the central bank, he should have known that all private sector entities are not fraudsters.  As an expert, there were high hopes from him, according to Pashupati Murarka, former president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. “But he failed to deliver as per expectation,” said Murarka. “We are disappointed with him particularly for his failure to introduce a fiscal policy to support the small businesses during this pandemic.” According to those who have followed Khatiwada’s policies and actions, over the last two years or so, it looked like he was confused whether to act as an economist or a politician. “Despite signing the agreement, he chose to remain mum on the United State’s Millennium Challenge Corporation Nepal Compact,” said the former bureaucrat. “Since the agreement had been signed, shouldn't he have defended the agreement?” The MCC has become a divisive force in the Nepal Communist Party and Khatiwada, according to the former bureaucrat, played safe, as he did not want to annoy his political masters. The private sector, however, sees Khatiwada as someone who failed to introduce any long-term reform moves for business entities, even though he had the opportunity.

11,Coronavirus patients in home isolation in Rupandehi complain of being neglected by authorities,"September 4, 2020","A 68-year-old woman from Tilottama Municipality Ward No. 5 in Rupandehi had tested positive for Covid-19 in the third week of August. A patient of diabetes and high blood pressure, she had been staying in home isolation despite her doctor suggesting she be placed in a hospital, as there were no beds available at the corona-specific hospital in Butwal. She died on Sunday, while on her way to Bhim Hospital in Bhairahawa. “We didn’t have a choice but to keep her at home despite her doctor suggesting otherwise. The municipality did not help us secure a bed in the isolation facility at the corona-specific hospital in Butwal,” said Ram Bahadur Gurung, one of the family members of the deceased. “On Sunday, her health condition worsened and we again asked the municipality to help us take her to the hospital. But they said all ICU beds in the hospital were taken.”  Gurung says the woman died due to the municipality’s neglect.  ""The authorities shirk their responsibility of coronavirus patients staying in home isolation. Despite our repeated requests, the municipality did not manage a bed for her in the isolation centre, where she would have received better care and treatment,” Gurung said.  Ishwori Paudel, the corona focal person of the municipality, admitted the municipality’s failure in helping the elderly woman with preexisting health conditions.  ""We were concerned about her condition. But we could not take her to the hospital since there was no bed available,"" said Paudel. Another virus-infected man staying in home isolation in Siddhartha Municipality Ward No. 8, Rupandehi, said he too is disappointed in the authorities’ response to patients staying in home isolation.  ""I was suffering from fever and dizziness a few days ago. I called the municipality’s health workers multiple times but they did not answer. One person finally received my call in the evening and suggested that I drink hot water and eat nutritious food. But nobody came to check up on me,"" said the man. “We only need health consultation. But the authorities here have failed to provide us with even that."" A total of 140 people tested positive for coronavirus in Siddharthanagar Municipality as of Tuesday morning with 84 active cases. Fifty-eight of them are in home isolation. Uma Thapa, chief at the health unit of the municipality, said that health workers have been unable to reach out to every patient in home isolation for a lack of manpower and resources such as ambulances and hospital beds. She, however, claimed that health workers were in regular contact with patients through phone calls. The number of patients staying in home isolation has increased in several districts of Province 5, as the existing hospitals in the province are already filled to their capacity. The province has only four corona-specific hospitals and 138 isolation centres to cover 12 districts. There are two corona-specific hospitals in Rupandehi district and one each in Butwal and Bhairahawa.  According to the Social Development Ministry, a total of 531 people are currently staying in home isolation in Province 5. As per the home isolation management regulation, health workers should immediately reach out to patients staying in home isolation and should inform the authorities about any health complications in the patient. Dr Pushpa Raj Paudel, the information officer at the ministry, claimed that the authorities allow patients to stay in home isolation only after monitoring their health condition and after ensuring their houses meet the standard required for home isolation.

12,Bagmati Province proposes converting private schools into trusts and cooperatives,"September 4, 2020","The Social Development Ministry of Bagmati Province has come up with a proposal to convert private schools into trusts or cooperatives in the spirit of the Constitution of Nepal and as suggested by the High-Level National Education Commission.  The proposal, which will come to effect after endorsement by the provincial Cabinet, will provide the basis for the provincial government to formulate a law to govern the education system within the province.  “Private schools will be converted into trusts and cooperatives,” reads one of the clauses of the draft policy. “The local governments will be supported to ensure there is only public education at the school level.”  Yubraj Dulal, Minister for Social Development of Bagmati province, said the draft policy would be presented before the Cabinet in a few weeks. He said that the policy related to the conversion of the private schools would remain intact when presented before the Cabinet, although some other provisions could be revised . “The provision was included as per the spirit of the Constitution of Nepal. The country can never move towards the path of socialism with private schools intact,” he told the Post.  The preamble of the constitution says Nepal is a socialism-oriented state. He said the policy is based on Article 31(2) of the constitution, which makes the state responsible to ensure compulsory basic education and free secondary education for all.  The government in August 2018 formed the High-level National Education Commission headed by Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel which on January 15, 2019 submitted its report to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli recommending to convert the private schools into trusts from companies within 10 years.  It said the conversion process would start in three years. However, the education policy endorsed by the Education Ministry in November last year didn’t have any provisions on ending private ownership of schools. Commenting on the ministry’s change of policy, members of the commission said the government was working at the behest of private schools by not rolling out any laws to control the privatisation of education.  Despite the federal government’s reluctance to implement the recommendations of the minister-led commission, which has not been made public, the Bagmati provincial government claiming its independent status maintains it can implement any policy in line with the constitution.  “Allowing private schools to operate in the present form would be against the spirit of the constitution which envisions for the free and compulsory education at the school level.” Dulal told the Post.  According to Ritu Raj Sapkota, the chairperson of National Private and Boarding Schools’ Association, Nepal, private schools across the country have invested Rs 600 billion in the business and 23 percent of schoolgoers attend private schools.  The provincial government believes implementing its policy will not be a problem in all its districts, barring the three districts in the Kathmandu Valley and in Chitwan. “The private schools will be supported to shift their priority towards higher education,” said Dulal. Of the 35,520 schools across the nation, 6,687 are private, according to the government’s economic survey for fiscal year 2019-20. There are 7,031 schools in total in Bagmati Province. The breakdown of private and public schools in Bagmati Province was not available. Of the total 7.021 million school students across the country 1.4 million are from Bagmati, according to the economic survey.  Compensation for the private school operators however would only be “nominal”, according to Dulal.  “Everyone has to abide by the law the state adopts,” he said when asked how possible it is to convert private schools into trusts. “There will be incentives for them.” Meanwhile, provincial lawmakers have also backed Bagmati government’s policy. “It is a long-term plan that will be implemented gradually. How long the conversion process takes will depend on how much money the government can allocate for it,” Ranta Dhakal, a member of the provincial assembly and former chairperson of All Nepal National Independent Students' Union-Revolutionary, told the Post.  Private school operators, on the other hand, are not happy with the plan.

13,Karnali suffers in absence of senior officials and Kathmandu transfers them frequently without consulting the province,"September 4, 2020","Tek Narayan Pandey, chief secretary of Karnali Province, was transferred to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation in Kathmandu on July 20. A day later secretary of the chief minister’s office Laxmi Kumar Basnet was deputed as acting chief secretary of the province. Barely, a month later, on August 25, however, the federal government transferred Basnet to the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation in Kathmandu, leaving the offices of the chief minister and the council of ministers without both the chief secretary and secretary. The provincial government has requested Basnet to postpone his move to Kathmandu until the arrival of a new chief secretary.  “We have requested Basnet to postpone his transfer but we are yet to get a reply. The federal government did not consult with the provincial government before making the transfer. We are in a difficult situation now since all administrative works of the provincial government have come to a halt,” said Bimala KC, spokesperson of Karnali government, who is also the Minister for Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives. “Karnali has failed to accomplish its development goals since its formation two and a half years ago. One of the main reasons for this is the absence of government officials in important positions.” The Karnali Province Assembly has already endorsed the provincial Public Service Commission Act. The formation of this Act has paved the way for the formulation of the provincial Civil Service Act. The latter Act will allow the province to make decisions on the hiring of officials in the province.  But since the federal government is yet to endorse the Federal Civil Service Act, the Provincial Civil Service Act remains to be formulated. Constitutionally, the provincial act is to be enacted as per the spirit of the federal act. The State Affairs Committee of the federal parliament has endorsed the Federal Civil Servant Bill but the parliament is yet to approve it.  While the provinces have been saying that the authority to appoint secretaries in provincial governments should be theirs in the spirit of federalism, the federal bill has given that authority to the federal government.  One of the factors leading to vacant senior positions in Karnali government is the remoteness of the region. With little to no facilities officials transferred from Kathmandu are used to available in the province, high-level government officials the federal government appoints ask to be transferred outside Karnali, says KC.  “In the past two and a half years, Karnali has seen four chief secretaries. None of them stayed for more than a few months before being transferred elsewhere—some sought their transfers while others were transferred by the federal government,” said KC. “Pandey, who was deputed as chief secretary of the province in mid-March, was in office for only four months before he was transferred to another federal ministry.”  Most of the managerial positions of Karnali Province have remained vacant since the formation of the provincial government.  “There should be level nine and level ten civil servants (of under secretary level) as division chiefs in the ministries while level eleven ones should be appointed as directors of the provincial directorates. But these offices have been operating with officials in acting positions since the formation of the provincial government,” said KC. “This has hindered the implementation of policies and programmes, and development plans in the province,”  In total there are 22 divisions and seven directorates in six different ministries of the Karnali government. Bishnu Prasad Adhikari, the spokesperson at the Social Development Ministry, said, “Junior officers have been given the responsibility of acting office chiefs and acting directors in almost all divisions and directorates in the absence of high-level government officials in the province.”  Chitra Bahadur Rokaya, a level nine official, is currently the acting director at the Agriculture Development Directorate. The position is of level eleven official.  “In the absence of a senior officer, our office is facing difficulties to meet its targets. I have to monitor fieldwork as well as administrative tasks,” Rokaya said. The Infrastructure Development Directorate, the only directorate under the Physical Infrastructure Development Ministry, is also being run by an acting office director. Basudev Paudel, a level ten civil servant, is the acting office chief now although only a level eleven government official is qualified to take that position.  “One of the three divisions under the Infrastructure Development Ministry does not even have an acting office chief,” Gopal Sharma, the ministry's spokesperson, said.  Similarly, two directorates under the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment are being run by acting directors. Shivaram Adhikari, a level nine civil servant, has been leading the Forest and Environment Directorate though the office should be led by a level eleven official. A junior officer, Mukundanath Yogi, is the acting director at Industry and Consumers Rights Protection Directorate.  According to the Office of Chief Minister, 998 of the total 2,555 posts in Karnali Province are vacant now.  Minister KC, the Karnali government's spokesperson, said it was hard to execute work in the province since the federal government does not send human resources to fill critical positions in the government offices.  “The provincial government does not have the authority to appoint employees yet and is reliant on the centre to fulfil its human resource needs in the provincial government offices,” KC said. The provincial government will have the authority once its Public Service Commission Act is implemented but that again is on hold as the federal parliament is yet to pass the Federal Civil Servant Act.  The provincial government had presented a total budget of Rs 34.34 billion in the last fiscal year 2019/20. However, only 35.37 percent of the budget was spent.

14,Delay in PCR test results has prompted Baglung to extend prohibitory order,"September 4, 2020","The District Administration Office in Baglung has been extending the prohibitory order it had imposed in mid-August due to the delay in receiving PCR reports of coronavirus suspects. On August 15, swab samples of 72 individuals at Galuwa in Baglung Municipality Ward No. 10 were sent for PCR test to the Pokhara-based provincial lab but the results have yet to come, prompting the authorities to extend the prohibitory order.  “We have extended the prohibitory order, which was to be lifted on September 3, until September 12,” said Chief District Officer in Baglung Suresh Neupane. “We may have to extend it further if we still don’t receive the results by then. We have tightened security in the district due to the increased risk of coronavirus spread.” Neupane said his office has yet to receive the reports of more than 70 samples that were sent to the lab.  “If we lift the order before we get the results, we may enable the virus to spread further. This is why we have continued the restrictions in the district,” Neupane said.  According to Jeeban Bhandari of Galuwa, many locals in the area have been exposed to the risk of contracting the virus after they attended a feast organised by an Army personnel on August 15. “The Army man who had organised the feast has tested positive for the coronavirus. Seventy-two individuals had attended the feast,” he said.  Meanwhile, the prolonged lockdown has severely affected businesses in the district, said Yubaraj Raj Bhandari, chairman at the Baglung Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  “The majority of businesses in the district are closed now but they still have to pay rents. Most businesses have now decided to close down for good,” Bhandari said. Ram Prasad Khanal, chief at the Health Section of Baglung Municipality, said, “It’s taking at least 10 days to receive the test results these days. The delay in the release of PCR test reports has led to a delay in contact tracing as well. The authorities cannot lift restrictive orders unless all infections are traced.” As of Thursday, 319 individuals tested positive for coronavirus in Baglung. Among them, 25 do not have any travel history. ",National,https://kathmandupost.com/gandaki-province/2020/09/04/delay-in-pcr-test-results-has-prompted-baglung-to-extend-prohibitory-order
15,Ruling party Secretariat decides to nominate Bamdev Gautam as Upper House member,"September 3, 2020","The ruling Nepal Communist Party on Thursday decided to recommend party vice-chair Bamdev Gautam as a member of the National Assembly. One seat has been vacant in the Upper House for the last six months since Yubaraj Khatiwada’s two-year tenure ended on March 3. “Today’s meeting of the Secretariat decided to send Gautam to the National Assembly,” said Jhalanath Khanal, a senior leader of the party and a member of the Secretariat.  Earlier on February 26, the party had decided to nominate Gautam to the National Assembly. The decision, however, had run into controversy within the party and it had remained unimplemented. If Gautam is sent to the National Assembly, Yubaraj Khatiwada won’t be able to continue as the finance minister.  As per constitutional provisions, a non-elected person can be appointed a minister but he or she needs to take the oath as a member either of the House of Representatives or the National Assembly within six months of the appointment.  Khatiwada will complete his six months as a minister without a membership of any of the two Houses of the federal parliament on Friday. Though Oli was for continuing Khatiwada as the finance minister, he was left with no choice as failure to abide by a deal he had reached with Gautam could have affected internal party dynamics, threatening his position as prime minister and party chair. Gautam, who lost the 2017 parliamentary elections, has emerged as a strongman in the party, especially the Secretariat, as his move to switch sides tilts the balance.  With Gautam on his side, Oli currently enjoys a majority in the nine-member Secretariat.",National,https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/03/ruling-party-secretariat-decides-to-nominate-bamdev-gautam-as-upper-house-member
16,Fifth BIMSTEC Summit proposed for January next year,"September 3, 2020","Sri Lanka, the current chair of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), has proposed to host the fifth summit of the regional grouping in the first half of January 2021, subject to the improved Covid-19 situation. The proposal was made during the 21st Session of Senior Officials' Meeting (SOM) on Wednesday. Member states will discuss later on the proposal and finalise the date and other agendas like holding the ministerial level meeting in Colombo ahead of the Summit, Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi, told the Post after the meeting.  The Summit, initially, was proposed for later this month, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was postponed. Member states agreed on Sri Lanka’s proposal to host the Summit and the ministerial level meeting next year, whose date will be confirmed later, Bairagi said.  After the Summit in Sri Lanka, the chairmanship of the regional bloc will be handed over to Thailand for the period of 2021-22. The meeting, which took place at the foreign secretary level of all seven member states, also finalised the much-awaited BIMSTEC charter, reviewed the progress made in the last two years after Kathmandu Summit and discussed issues of legal instruments of the regional grouping and how to move on to establish the regional centrse and mechanisms, according to Bairagi.  Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Myanmar are the member states of BIMSTEC that is often touted as a parallel of another regional organization–South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation or SAARC.  The 21st session of Senior Officials' Meeting (SOM) took stock of progress made in various areas of cooperation under BIMSTEC, endorsed the appointment of next secretary general, finalised the draft of the BIMSTEC charter and the draft of the Memorandum of Association on the Establishment of BIMSTEC Centers/Entities, among others, according to a foreign ministry statement.  In the absence of a dedicated charter, BIMSTEC is running with the spirit of the Bangkok Declaration of 1997 and the charter is now in the final stage, which is expected to come out from the Colombo Summit. Officials said that besides finalizing the charter, the meeting of senior officials also recommended signing of the Convention on Cooperation on Criminal and Legal Matters among the member states during the Summit.  Similarly, member states have also agreed to sign an agreement on Bimstec Technology Transfer Facilities, Cooperation among Diplomatic Training Academies and persons, building templates on BIMSTEC centers, entities and mechanism and finalisation of BIMSTEC Transport Connectivity Master Plan during the Colombo Summit. The foreign secretary level meeting also approved the nomination of new secretary general from Bhutan. Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, hosts the BIMSTEC Secretariat.

17,"At least 14 dead, 41 missing in flood and landslide in Baglung","September 3, 2020","Nim Bahadur BK, a resident of Lankuribot in Dhorpatan Municipality Ward No. 9, Baglung district, woke up to find his house shaking on Wednesday midnight. The 45-year-old woke his wife and three children up and rushed outside just before the floodwaters from Bhuji River swept his house away. “We spent the night under the open sky in the pouring rain,” said BK.  Fourteen people died while at least 41 others went missing in Wednesday night's flood and landslide in Dhorpatan Municipality.  “Three individuals have been injured in the disaster and are currently receiving treatment at Burtibang Health Post,” said Inspector Prakash Singh Bhandari of the Area Police Office in Burtibang.  “The bodies of 14 individuals were recovered from the landslide site and by the banks of Bhuji River by late Thursday evening,” said Chief District Officer Suresh Neupane. “The identities of two of the deceased have been established so far.” According to Yam Bahadur Kayat, principal at Gyanodaya Secondary School in Dhortapan, a landslide triggered by heavy rainfall had occurred at Deurali along the Dhorpatan-Saljhandi road section on Wednesday night.  “The landslide debris led to a dam formation, blocking the flow of Bhuji River. The dam burst and the flooded river entered the settlements,” Kayat said.  The incident site is some 130km west of Baglung district headquarters. A preliminary report on the incident says the flooded river swept away at least 40 houses downstream in Wards 7, 8 and 9 of Dhorpatan Municipality.  According to Neupane, the flood also swept away large swathes of cultivable land in the municipality. Security personnel with the help of locals carried out search and rescue works on Thursday.  “The search for the missing individuals is still on,” said Inspector Bhandari.  But conducting rescue operations has been difficult given the incessant rainfall the area has been witnessing for the past few days. “We were informed about the incident on Wednesday night but could start rescue operations only in the morning when the rain had turned into a slight drizzle,” said Neupane.  Vehicular movement along the Dhorpatan-Saljhandi road section had been affected since the beginning of the monsoon season but the recent disaster has brought movement along the road section to a complete halt. “The disaster has caused massive damage to various road sections, hydropower projects, health posts and drinking water spouts in the area,” said Dhan Prasad Pokharel, chief administrative officer at Dhorpatan Municipality. However, locals say that there were fewer casualties, as most of the houses along the Bhuji river banks were unoccupied when the disaster struck. “Most of the villagers had gone to the upper regions with their cattle when the monsoons arrived. The casualties might have been higher if all the villagers had been home on Wednesday night,” said Fulmaya Pun, a local who survived the incident.  Dhorpatan Municipality Mayor Devkumar Nepali said that the municipal office is making arrangements to provide relief to the victims of the disaster.",National,https://kathmandupost.com/gandaki-province/2020/09/03/overnight-flood-landslides-in-baglung-claim-eight-lives-13-still-missing
18,Ruling party Secretariat meeting deferred until 3pm as leadership faces tough choice between Khatiwada and Gautam,"September 3, 2020","The Secretariat meeting of the ruling Nepal Communist Party scheduled for 11am on Thursday has been postponed until 3pm after the top leadership failed to reach consensus on who to pick as a member of the National Assembly. Surya Thapa, press advisor to party chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, said that the meeting has been postponed until 3pm.  If Oli has to continue Yubaraj Khatiwada as the finance minister, Khatiwada must be appointed the National Assembly member by Friday, but party vice-chair Bamdev Gautam is also vying for the Upper House seat. Khatiwada was reappointed finance minister on March 4 after his two-year tenure as the National Assembly member expired. As per constitutional provisions, a non-elected person can be appointed a minister but he or she needs to take the oath as a member either of the House of Representatives or the National Assembly within six months of the appointment. Khatiwada will complete his six months as a minister without a membership in any of the two Houses of Parliament on Friday. Oli and the other chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Wednesday had held a meeting to discuss who–Khatiwada or Gautam–to make the National Assembly member. But the leaders could not reach an agreement. According to insiders, Oli later on Wednesday had urged Gautam not to aspire for the National Assembly and rather prepare to contest an election from any constituency for the House of Representatives. If Gautam is to contest for a House of Representatives seat, the ruling party needs to ask one of its lawmakers to resign. But Gautam is not keen to contest the election, a leader close to him said.  There’s only one seat vacant in the National Assembly.

19,Two former lawmakers stage indefinite hunger strike demanding justice for Dalit youth who died in custody,"September 3, 2020","Two former lawmakers have started an indefinite hunger strike at Garuda in Rautahat district, demanding justice for 19-year-old Bijay Mahara who died after allegedly being tortured by police in custody. Bishwendra Pasawan and Ramprit Paswan have been staging a fast-unto-death strike outside the Area Police Office in Garuda since Tuesday evening, demanding a fair investigation into Bijay’s death. As the health of Bishwendra deteriorated overnight, he was given saline solution on Wednesday.  Bijay and six others were arrested on August 19 in connection to the murder of Niranjan Ram, a local teenager, in Garuda Municipality. Bijay died on August 26  at National Medical College in Birgunj. His family members have claimed that he was tortured in custody.  Police have been saying that Bijay died in the course of treatment for a kidney ailment. However, a video of Bijay, which was taken in hospital prior to his death, shows him saying that he was indeed tortured by plainclothes police and forced to confess to the August 16 murder of 17-year-old Niranjan. Bijay’s death has sparked protests in Rautahat. Friends and relatives of the Dalit youth, local people and rights activists have been staging demonstrations in Garuda Bazar for the past one week. They have refused to accept the probe committee formed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and called for the formation of an impartial investigation team to find the truth behind the death of Bijay as well as Niranjan, action against the guilty and suitable compensation to the family of the deceased.  Family members and friends of Bijay have claimed that Police Inspector Nabin Singh and the head constable duo Munna Singh and Firoj Alam, had tortured Bijay at the instruction of the District Police Office. ""The police involved in torturing him should be punished,"" demanded Panilal, Bijay's father. Following widespread protests, the Ministry of Home Affairs on Tuesday suspended Inspector Singh of the District Police Office, Gaur. While the Janakpur Police Office suspended the two head constables—Feroz Miya Dhuniya and Mannu Kumar Singh— for their alleged involvement in the incident. The demonstrators have also been demanding that the police release four other youths who were arrested with Bijay. ""We will continue our protest until and unless our demands are addressed,"" said Sonelal Ram, the coordinator of a struggle committee formed to demand justice for Bijay. The local administration has called the families of Bijay and Niranjan to sit for talks, but to no avail.  ""The two sides have so far refused our invite for a dialogue,"" said Indradev Yadav, the Chief District Officer of Rautahat. A source at the Area Police Office in Garuda said that three police officers from the crime branch of the District Police Office had tortured Bijay in custody bypassing an investigation officer designated to probe Niranjan murder case.  According to the source, they took Bijay and Sikendra Pasawan, another suspect, to a detention room and forced them to confess to the Niranjan’s murder.  Niranjan’s body was discovered by locals on August 15. A police team led by Deputy Superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato, the then chief at the Area Police Office in Garuda, had then reached the site to collect the body and look for evidence. A team, led by Inspector Kedarman Dong, was formed to investigate the case.  The team detained Sheikh Aazad and 10 other locals, including Bijay, on August 16. Four of the suspects were released the next day. On August 18, Superintendent of Police Rabiraj Khadka, the district police chief, deployed Inspector Nabin Singh and the head constable duo Munna Singh and Firoj Alam, to Garuda to investigate the Niranjan murder case.  Inspector Dong refused to give details about the incident, nor did he say anything about the Inspector Singh-led team taking over the investigation. ",National,https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2020/09/03/two-former-lawmakers-stage-indefinite-hunger-strike-demanding-justice-for-dalit-youth-who-died-in-custody
20,Can Gautam become a minister? Depends which Article gets invoked.,"September 6, 2020","The ruling Nepal Communist Party’s decision to nominate Bamdev Gautam to the National Assembly so as to take him to the Cabinet has stoked a debate whether the constitution allows him to become a minister, as he had lost the parliamentary elections in 2017. Legal opinions are divided–some say the constitution does not bar him from becoming a minister, while others say it does.  Constitutional lawyer Bhimarjun Acharya says appointing Gautam as a minister will be a clear violation of Article 78 (4) of the constitution. Article 78 (4) says: A person who has been defeated in the election to the then House of Representatives shall not be qualified to be appointed to the office of Minister during the term of such House of Representatives. “Since Article 78 (4) talks about a person who has lost the Lower House elections, such a person cannot be a minister,” Acharya told the Post.  Others say the constitution does bar Gautam from becoming a minister, as Article 76 (9) of the constitution will be invoked. Article 76 (9) says: The President shall, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, constitute the Council of Ministers comprising a maximum of twenty-five Ministers including the Prime Minister, in accordance with the inclusive principle, from amongst the members of the Federal Parliament. The Post reached out to at least two members of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly to inquire about the ambiguity. According to them, the five-year moratorium for those losing the elections was written in the constitution with good intentions, as there were concerns during the time of drafting also that a situation might arise when some defeated politicians would try to use their clout to become ministers. “The provision [Article 78 (4)] was included after a long discussion,” said Som Prasad Pandey, who was a member in the drafting committee representing then CPN-UML “We, however, could not foresee that the parties would appoint an individual to the Upper House even after losing the Lower House elections.” According to Pandey, who is a member of the House of Representatives representing the ruling Nepal Communist Party, it would be against the spirit of the constitution to appoint someone defeated in the elections as a minister. Rewati Raman Bhandari, who was also a member of the drafting committee representing then CPN-UML, said appointing someone who was defeated in the elections to the House of Representatives as a minister will raise legal questions. “Appointing a person who lost the elections to the Upper House itself is against the spirit of the constitution,” Bhandari, who is currently the chair of the law commission in Province 1, told the Post.  Bhandari, who is also a lawyer, conceded that the ambiguity has surfaced because the drafters failed to foresee situations like today’s, when Gautam is being taken to the National Assembly by his party with a view to making him a minister.  Gautam, however, won’t be the first politician to reach the National Assembly when he is appointed even after losing the parliamentary elections. Nepal Communist Party spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who also lost the 2017 elections, was appointed to the National Assembly back in January. So how does the ambiguity arise? Experts say it depends on which Article is invoked. If Article 78 (4) is to be invoked, it clearly bars Gautam’s appointment as a minister. But if Article 76 (9) is invoked, it gives the prerogative to the prime minister.  The House of Representatives and the National Assembly together make the federal parliament. So, according to legal experts, even if the person has lost the elections, once he or she is appointed to the National Assembly, they “become” a member of the federal parliament. And by that extension, the individual is eligible to become the minister. Senior advocate Chandra Kanta Gyawali, who also specialises in constitutional law, said Article 78 (4) comes into play whenever attempts are made to appoint a person who lost the elections.  In Gautam’s case, the process to appoint him as a minister will be initiated only after his entry into the Upper House, which makes him a member of the federal parliament, according to Gyawali. “The constitution doesn’t stop a lawmaker from becoming a minister,” Gyawali told the Post.  Those involved in the drafting of the constitution admit that provisions could have been written in a more clear way and that multiple aspects should have been taken into consideration and foreseen.  “I agree that the drafters could have written the provisions more clearly,” said Bhandari. “If legal complexity arises, the Supreme Court will decide, as it is the final interpreter of the constitution.” Yet another ambiguity in the constitution had surfaced in December last year, when then Samajbadi Party withdrew its support to the KP Oli government. There was a debate if Oli needed to face the floor test.  Some said he needs to table a motion as per Article 100 (2) of the constitution, while others said as the Nepal Communist Party holds a comfortable majority, it was not necessary for Oli to pass the floor test even if a party pulled out its support.  Those involved in the drafting process had said the provision of the motion of the vote of confidence was introduced as they didn’t envision that there would ever be a majority government due to the electoral system Nepal has adopted. They had said that they didn’t expect any party to get a comfortable majority in the mixed—first-past-the-post and the proportional representation—electoral system.  Then CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) had forged an electoral alliance in 2017. Since they merged after the elections to become the Nepal Communist Party, the party won a comfortable majority. Bhandari said ambiguities in the constitutional provisions should not be taken otherwise.  “The constitution is a living document and constitutional practice an evolving process,” said Bhandari. “We have the Supreme Court as the ultimate interpreter of the constitution and the Constitutional Bench as arbiter, should constitutional problems arise.” Legal experts who say the constitution bars Gautam from becoming the minister say in Article 76 (9), the phrase “... from amongst lawmakers” should be interpreted in its spirit that it recognises those as lawmakers who won the elections and not those who lost but were later appointed to the Upper House. “It is wrong to say appointing Gautam a minister is the prime minister’s prerogative, when there is a clear provision that bars him from becoming a member of the Council of Ministers,” said Acharya, the constitutional lawyer. For non-elected individuals to become a minister, the constitution has a different provision altogether, as per which Yubaraj Khatiwada was appointed finance minister on March 4.  According to Article 78 (1), the President may, on the recommendation of the prime minister, appoint a person who is not a member of the federal parliament as a minister and the minister.  After Khatiwada’s two-year tenure ended on March 3, he was reappointed. But he had to resign on Friday, as Article 78 (2) says if a non-elected person is appointed a minister, he or she must obtain membership of the federal parliament within six months from the date of taking oath. Oli bade farewell to Khatiwada despite wanting to continue him as his finance minister because he was under pressure to take Gautam to the National Assembly where only one seat is vacant.  Gyawali, the constitutional lawyer, said once Gautam is appointed to the Upper House, as per constitutional provisions, it’s up to the prime minister and that he can appoint him as a member of his Cabinet.",Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/09/06/can-gautam-become-a-minister-depends-which-article-gets-invoked
21,Yubaraj Khatiwada resigns as finance and communication minister,"September 4, 2020","Yubaraj Khatiwada resigned as minister for finance and minister for communication and information technology on Friday, a day after the ruling Nepal Communist Party decided not to appoint him to the National Assembly. His appointment to the National Assembly was crucial for him to continue as the minister. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had reappointed Khatiwada as the finance minister on March 4 after he completed his tw0-year tenure as the National Assembly member on March 3. As per constitutional provisions, if a non-elected person is appointed a minister, he or she needs to take the oath as a member either of the House of Representatives or the National Assembly within six months of the appointment. There is only one seat vacant in the National Assembly and the ruling party on Thursday decided to nominate party vice-chair Bamdev Gautam. ""Khatiwada submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Oli today,"" said Surya Thapa, Oli’s press advisor. As a minister for communication and information technology, Khatiwada was also the government's spokesperson. Meanwhile, Oli has himself taken the responsibilities of both ministries.  “President Bidya Devi Bhandari has endorsed the recommendation of the Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to take the responsibilities of both finance and communication and information technology ministries after the resignation of Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada,” reads a statement released by the president’s office.",Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/09/04/yubaraj-khatiwada-resigns-as-finance-and-communication-minister
22,"Ruling party decision on Gautam is mockery of democracy, experts say","September 4, 2020","The ruling Nepal Communist Party’s decision to nominate party vice-chair Bamdev Gautam as National Assembly member has once again raised the question: Have Nepali politicians indeed internalised the concept of bicameral legislature, and the essence of the Upper House in its truest sense? Constitutional experts say the decision to send Gautam to the Upper House is problematic, prima facie, as he lost the 2017 parliamentary elections. Appointing a person who was rejected by the people to the hallowed chambers of the National Assembly is akin to disrespecting the electorate, and by extension democracy, they say. Purna Man Shakya, a senior constitutional lawyer, said the National Assembly, in principle, is envisaged as a place where people from diverse groups, marginalised communities, intellectuals, experts and representatives of different provinces come together to make laws. “The government must answer and explain to the people how its decision is in accordance with the spirit of the constitution and the objectives of the National Assembly,” Shakya told the Post. “This is a question of propriety.” Gautam is the second politician to be appointed to the National Assembly even after losing parliamentary elections. In January , Nepal Communist Party spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha was appointed to the Upper House. While Gautam lost the contest for the Bardiya constituency during the 2017 elections to Sanjay Gautam of the Nepali Congress, Shrestha couldn’t beat Baburam Bhattarai of then Naya Shakti Party for the Gorkha-1 seat . According to a report by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an organisation promoting sustainable democracy, members of the Upper House should be picked in such a way that they represent sub-national governments, and act as a body of experts to scrutinise decisions made by the Lower House.  Constitutional and political experts say the electorate for the National Assembly is different from that of the House of Representatives to ensure that people different from those in the Lower House make it to the Upper House. Article 86 of the Constitution of Nepal authorises the President to nominate three people, including a woman, to the 59-member Upper House. Constitutional and political experts say that such seats should be reserved for people from underrepresented communities or for those who have specialisation in various fields. The nomination of Yubaraj Khatiwada, who has faced criticism for his policies as finance minister, escaped censure as he is a technocrat who holds a PhD and has served twice at the National Planning Commission as its vice-chair and once at the Nepal Rastra Bank as its governor. The other two people nominated to the Upper House by the President, along with Khatiwada, are Bimala Poudel Rai and Ram Narayan Bidari. With the ruling party’s decision to nominate Gautam, the government now has to recommend Gautam’s name to the President for the National Assembly seat. The presidential nomination in the Upper House, however, has become a tool to “manage” leaders of the Nepal Communist Party, experts say. “The National Assembly in Nepal is turning into an extension of the House of Representatives to manage leaders who either don’t contest the parliamentary polls or those who lose in the polls,” said Bipin Adhikari, a senior constitutional lawyer and former dean at Kathmandu University School of Law.  Even if Khatiwada were nominated, it would have been wrong this time as he has already completed his tenure, said Adhikari. Experts say the concept of the National Assembly is derived from the principles laid out by the House of Lords in the United Kingdom. Though its representation and functions vary from country to country its primary role is to conduct informed and intellectual deliberations on the legislation.  The Upper House, also called the “House of Elders”, often has to maintain checks and balances on the Lower House. As the Upper House is expected to make mature decisions, the age threshold for membership is higher than that of the Lower House. Article 87 (b) of the constitution says that citizens who have completed 25 years of age can run for a seat in the House of Representatives. However, that for the National Assembly is 35. “In essence, the National Assembly’s place is even higher in a federal country like ours where it is recognised as a Federal House. This House should represent all the provinces and local levels,” said Adhikari. “Thursday's decision of the ruling party [to nominate Gautam as member of the Upper House] is yet another example of how it [the ruling party] is undermining the value of the Upper House.” Political analysts say the ruling party might argue that there aren’t any constitutional barriers for the government to nominate Gautam, but in politics, morality and propriety should get equal attention. “The question is if our parties have anything left in them to be judged on moral grounds,” said Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science at Tribhuvan University.  According to Pokhrel, Nepali politicians have for long nurtured undemocratic practices. “Madhav Kumar Nepal, a Nepal Communist Party leader, became prime minister of the country despite losing the Constituent Assembly elections in 2008. Gautam also became home minister even though the people rejected him the same year,” said Pokhrel. “This wrong practice has been going on for years. Gautam’s nomination to the Upper House is just another instance.” Apart from making laws, the Upper House also checks and challenges the actions of the government, while offering a platform for independent expertise. But when the ruling party cherrypicks someone to install them in the Upper House, then they will toe the government's line and not question its actions, critics say.  Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political commentator, said the people are considered sovereign in a democracy, but Thursday's decision of the ruling party shows leaders are the ones enjoying sovereign authority.  “This is a mockery of democratic values and the people’s mandate which clearly says Gautam should stay away from legislation at least for five years,” he told the Post. “When leaders start undermining the people’s mandate, it indicates that our democracy is on a slippery slope.""",Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/09/04/ruling-party-decision-on-gautam-is-mockery-of-democracy-experts-say
23,Uncertainty over convention date hasn’t deterred Congress leadership hopefuls from vying for support,"September 3, 2020","There is uncertainty over the Nepali Congress general convention taking place in February next year  due to the coronavirus crisis, but this hasn’t stopped party leaders from announcing their aspirations for the presidency. Including incumbent President Sher Bahadur Deuba, there are at least nine leaders from the party who want to lead the party after the general convention scheduled for February next year.  While some have publicly announced their intent to run for the party presidency so that they can bargain for important positions later,there are a few leaders who are actually preparing the groundwork to contest in the position. Party leaders say it is not unnatural to have more aspirants in the party that has many senior leaders.  “Every leader has an aspiration to command the party,” said Prakash Saran Mahat, party’s deputy general secretary. “The scenario, however, will change when the actual contest begins.”  The 14th general convention of the Nepali Congress is scheduled to take place from February 19 to 22 next year.  President Deuba wants to retain his position for a second time. Deuba, who has not hidden his aspiration to become the prime minister, knows that he must win the party leadership fight to fulfil his dream of re-entering Singhadurbar—something he says has been foretold by his astrologer.  Senior leader Ram Chandra Poudel, who lost to Deuba in the presidential race in the 13th general convention in 2016, is another aspirant for the position. Already in his mid-seventies, Poudel believes the upcoming convention is the last opportunity for him to get to the helm the party.  However, the high number of aspirants from the opposition faction could prove to be a hurdle for him. He needs to appease the first to keep his hopes alive. One such rival is Shashank Koirala, the current general secretary and son of the one of the party’s founders B. P. Koirala.  To this day, the Koirala clan is considered the saviour of the party by many. And Shashank is not the only Koirala that Poudel needs to contend with. Shekhar Koirala, also of the Koirala clan, is also in the fray, making Poudel’s job doubly difficult to win over others in his faction. Meanwhile, Poudel is also not getting any support from Prakash Man Singh and Ram Sharan Mahat, who had thrown their weights behind him during the last general convention. Both SIngh and Mahat have expressed their interest to run for the presidency this time. And then there is also Arjun Narsingh KC, another senior party leader, eyeing for the top post.  Leaders from the Poudel faction say they are concerned about the many aspirants from their side. They say their hope to wrest the party’s reins from Deuba will not materialise if they have more than one candidate coe February.  “Having more than one candidate from our faction would mean giving the party’s leadership to the establishment again. This we have discussed and warned of in several of our meetings,” Badri Pandey, a Central Working Committee member, told the Post. “We are building a pressure to have a single panel from our side and include the faction led by Krishna Prasad Sitaula.”  During the 13th general convention, Sitaula had formed a third faction within the Congress party, inducting youth leaders Gagan Thapa and Uma Kant Chaudhary.  Sitaula has been busy attending the meetings with rival factions these days.  Pandey says as most of the senior leaders are already in their 60’s or 70’s, they say they would be too old to contest for the leadership after the 14th general convention.  “They believe their chance of victory will get slimmer next time round as a new generation will be ready by then. While that could be true, announcing candidacy alone without a prospect of victory is useless,” said Pandey.  Poudel is 75 while Shekhar and Mahat both are 69. KC and Sitaula are 71 years old. Comparatively, younger leaders from the Poudel faction are Singh and Shashak who are 64 and 61 years old respectively. The increasing number of aspirants has also troubled the establishment faction. With Bimalendra Nidhi, the party’s deputy president, expressing his interest, the path for the party leadership is not going to be a smooth sailing for Deuba.  Besides Nidhi, the party’s former vice-president Gopal Man Shrestha, also of the Deuba faction, has also announced that he too will be contesting for the party presidency.  “A month ago, I told Deuba that he should consider others for the party president this time,” Shrestha told the Post, “I am equally senior as Deuba and Poudel in the party.” Shrestha, who chairs an organisational department in the party, said he has already started the groundwork for election to the party leadership.  But a central working committee leader close to Deuba said he expects both Nidhi and Shrestha to support Deuba.  “So many aspirants from the establishment side isn't pleasant news. The party president expects to forge a consensus by the time of the general convention,” another leader close to Deuba told the Post.  Though the race for the party leadership is hotting up, it is not sure whether the convention will even take place in the stipulated time. The party had announced to complete the distribution of the active membership by mid-August. However, that hasn’t begun yet.  The party has announced to double the active membership before the upcoming convention, a demanding and time-consuming task.  “The Covid-19 pandemic has affected our plans. The central working committee meeting will evaluate and decide whether the convention is possible in the stipulated time,” said Mahat, party’s deputy general secretary.  The next central working committee meeting is expected to be held once the prohibitory orders in the Valley are lifted. Mahat said that even if the convention is postponed, it will not be pushed by a long.  Observers, meanwhile, say if the number of presidential aspirants remain the same come the general convention, it could break the existing dynamics in the party.

If he decides to continue with Khatiwada, Gautam can upset the apple cart in the party. “If Oli remains adamant on continuing with Khatiwada, it could be a risky game for him,” said a Standing Committee member who did not wish to be named. “It had taken a lot for Oli to regain his strength in the party and ensure that the party remained united.” Until a few months ago, Oli was under huge pressure to step down both as party chair and prime minister.  Those at the forefront demanding his resignation were other chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and senior leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal and Narayan Kaji Shrestha.  The Dahal faction had Gautam’s backing too. With five leaders on one side, Oli was in the minority in the nine-member Secretariat. In the 44-member Standing Committee too, the Dahal faction commanded the majority. But Oli on July 28 pulled off a coup in quite a dramatic fashion. He, along with his wife Radhika Shakya, suddenly visited Gautam’s residence in Bhaisepati, held a dinner meeting with the Gautam family and returned to Baluwatar.  He then got Dahal into talking. Both held several rounds of talks. With Gautam into his fold, Oli was emboldened. He reached an understanding with Dahal. Both the chairs formed a task force that suggested Oli would lead the government for the full term and Dahal would run the party with “expanded roles”. The party escaped the imminent danger of a split and Oli saved his both positions. According to party insiders, Oli is for giving continuation to Khatiwada as the finance minister, for “his ability to ensure aid and investment” which will be crucial in such a difficult situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic.  But for Khatiwada to continue as the finance minister, he needs to be appointed a member of the National Assembly, again, within the end of this week. As per constitutional provisions, a non-elected person can be appointed a minister but he or she has to take the oath as a member of either the House of Representatives or the National Assembly within six months of the appointment. Even after an earlier term of Khatiwada, who was earlier a nominated member in the National Assembly, expired in March, Oli had appointed him finance minister on March 4.  Since there is only one seat vacant, Khatiwada’s appointment will mean Gautam will not have a chance to reach the National Assembly.  “The prime minister wants consensus on such issues and I think he will not go against the majority leaders,” said Bishnu Rimal, Oli’s chief advisor. “The prime minister will respect the decision of the top leaders.” Insiders say Gautam has already met with Oli and urged him to take him to the National Assembly, promising all the support the party chair needs to succeed as the prime minister.  Gautam, according to a leader close to him, urged Oli to respect the February 26 decision to appoint him National Assembly member. A meeting of the party Secretariat meeting on February 26 had decided to appoint Gautam as National Assembly member. The party, however, could not implement the decision due to the opposition from a section of the leaders within the party as well as for the fear of controversy.  As the Secretariat meets on Thursday with a host of agenda including a Cabinet reshuffle, Gautam is likely to mount pressure on the Secretariat and prime minister to take a decision in line with the February 26 understanding. A leader said the issue of Gautam and Khatiwada could overshadow other issues at the Secretariat meeting which is also scheduled to discuss a report prepared by the six-member task force that has made several recommendations for running the party and the government in tandem. If Gautam refuses to budge from his stance, Oli might have to ask any other National Assembly member to step down so that both Gautam and Khatiwada can be appointed, according to a leader who also spoke on condition of anonymity. “Or else, Oli has to make any other proposal to Gautam so as to stop him from lobbying for the National Assembly seat.”  Gautam is also seeking Dahal’s support in his bid to go to the National Assembly, according to the leader.  Insiders say it is not yet clear if Dahal will throw his weight behind Gautam, given his move to abandon him after Oli visited his house. While Gautam is considered a gadfly in the party by many for frequently changing camps, he has also emerged as a lynchpin in the party lately.

25,"As Janata Samajbadi Party attempts to conclude unity, Province 2 government likely to have an impact","August 31, 2020","As the Janata Samajbadi Party, which was born out of a hasty deal between Samajbadi Party Nepal and Rastriya Janata Party Nepal, looks to complete its unification process by dividing roles for its top leaders, the impact of the merger is likely to be seen on the Province 2 government. The two parties had formed a coalition government in Province 2 after the 2017 elections, with Lal Babu Raut of Samajbadi Party as chief minister. Even though the two parties, both with their large vote base in Madhes, were mulling unification, they declared their merger on April 22. Their unity, however, has been hamstrung by leaders’ egos. On Friday, three senior leaders of the party–Baburam Bhattarai, Rajendra Mahato and Ashok Rai–held a meeting to expedite the party unification process by integrating the leaders.  “Despite restrictions due to Covid-19, we have been holding discussions on a regular basis,” said Mahato, a senior leader of the party.  Just as the party is working on work divisions of its top leaders, concerns are also emerging about the Raut-led government’s performance. A major conflict is likely to arise between Raut and Jitendra Sonal.  Raut was elected chief minister as he was the leader of the parliamentary party of the Samajbadi Party in Province 2 Provincial Assembly. Sonal was the leader of the parliamentary party of the Janata Party. In the 107-member Provincial Assembly, Samajbadi Party has 30 seats and Janata Party has 25 seats. Since the two parties have now united to become Janata Samajbadi Party, it can have only one parliamentary party leader. Janata Samajbadi Party chair Mahantha Thakur hinted at the possibility of a change of guard in Province 2 but stressed that completion of the unification process is a priority. “We are working to complete the integration of central level committees and then elect the leader of our parliamentary party in the Provincial Assembly,” Thakur told the Post. “Government leadership and some reshuffle cannot be ruled out.” Multiple leaders from both the constituent parties the Post spoke to admitted that there have been concerns about the Raut government’s performance. “The Raut government has failed almost on all fronts, and most of the Provincial Assembly members are for a change in the overall set-up,” said Manish Suman, a member of the Janata Samajbadi Party executive committee. “In about two years, we will go to the elections again, and delivery is key. If we want to win the elections, we must be able to give a sense to the people of proper governance.” According to leaders, the Raut-led government faces corruption accusations. It has also failed to spend the budget.  “Due to the government’s apathy, people suffered a lot in quarantine facilities,” said a central leader of the party who spoke on condition of anonymity.  In recent months, Raut has been charged with failing to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. Province 2 so far has reported 10,719 Covid-19 infections, with 86 deaths. The party currently has a big executive committee, with 701 members. It is also facing a challenge when it comes to fixing the hierarchy of the top leaders. In the Samajbadi Party, Upendra Yadav and Baburam Bhattarai lead the central committee and the federal council respectively. Then there are other senior leaders who also want “respectable space” in the unified party. The Samajbadi Party was formed on May 7 last year after the merger between Yadvav’s Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum and Bhattarai’s Naya Shakti Nepal. The Rastriya Janata Party, meanwhile, was formed by six Madhes-based parties that were under the umbrella of the Samyukta Loktantrik Madhesi Morcha. They had united in April 2017, on the eve of the elections. Party insiders admit that there are too many leaders whose egos need to be managed to complete the unity and while doing so, its repercussions could be seen in the Province 2 government. The provincial government has a seven-member Cabinet with six full ministers besides the chief minister. The six ministries were equally divided between the Samajbadi Party and Janata Party.  It has six state ministers.  Party leaders, however, are also concerned as to what message a change in government in the provide could give to their electorate. Province 2 is the only province where the Nepal Communist Party does not govern.  With 32 seats, the Janata Samajbadi Party is the third largest force in the federal parliament. Even though the federal parliament has already been notified of the formal registration of the Janata Samajbadi Party at the Election Commission, it is yet to decide on its parliamentary party leader. Before their merger, Rajendra Mahato of the Janata Party and Yadav of the Samajbadi Party were the leaders of their respective parliamentary parties. Insiders say both want to be the leader of the parliamentary party in the federal parliament, and unless this settles, it will be difficult to predict a new equation. Yadav said they will first settle all the issues at the central level. “After addressing the outstanding issues like integration of party committees and work divisions among the leaders, the party will decide on the leader of the parliamentary party in Province 2,” Yadav told the Post. “We will take all the decisions in consensus after assessing the overall performance of the Province 2 government.” At the provincial level, at least four leaders are vying for the post of the parliamentary party leader –Chief Minister Raut, Finance Minister Bijay Yadav, Physical Planning Minister Sonal and Manish Suman. According to insiders, all of them have started lobbying with the top leaders as there is a constitutional provision that the Province Chief should appoint the leader of the parliamentary party commanding a majority in the provincial assembly. Article 168 (1) of the Constitution states that the Chief of the Province shall appoint the leader of the parliamentary party commanding a majority in the Province Assembly as the Chief Minister, and the Provincial Council of Ministers shall be constituted under his or her chairpersonship. Leaders from the former Janata Party say Raut should hand over the reins to one of their leaders, as he, from Samajbadi Party, has already led the government for more than half the term.  Leaders of the former Samajbadi Party, including Upendra Yadav, however, say rather than changing the chief minister, a Cabinet reshuffle could be possible evaluating the government performance so far. Keshav Jha, who was one of the general secretaries in the former Rastriya Janata Party, said it will take some time before changes are effected in the Province 2 government. “The party will elect the new parliamentary party leader at the province after finalising the Central Committee,” Jha, a member of the executive committee, told the Post.  The party in the meantime is also considering ways to deal with the new equation that has emerged. Since Janata Samajbadi Party is now one united force, it cannot hold both Speaker and Deputy Speaker posts in the Provincial Assembly.  Leaders say a deal with Nepal Communist Party which has 32 seats is unlikely, hence the party could reach some understanding with the Nepali Congress, which has 19 seats.",Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/08/31/as-janata-samajbadi-party-attempts-to-conclude-unity-province-2-government-likely-to-have-an-impact
26,Ruling party’s Secretariat meeting scheduled for Saturday postponed until September 3,"August 28, 2020","The ruling Nepal Communist Party’s Secretariat meeting scheduled for Saturday has been postponed until Thursday (September 3). “The decision to postpone the meeting was taken after a meeting between the two party chairs on Friday,” said Bishnu Sapkota, press coordinator of party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Party sources said the decision to defer the meeting was taken in light of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. According to the sources, the decision to defer the meeting was taken after two Secretariat members–Deputy Prime Minister Ishwor Pokharel and Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa-had to stay in isolation after some of the government staff working as office assistants at the Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre tested positive for Covid-19. Dipendra Shrestha, personal secretary of Pokhrel, confirmed that Pokhrel is in home isolation.  Saturday’s Secretariat meeting was supposed to discuss a report submitted by the six-member task force.

27,"In Nepal Communist Party, the two chairs are the party","August 28, 2020","The dust has finally settled in the ruling party–or at least it appears so. After months of squabbling, party chairs KP Sharma Oli, also the prime minister, and Pushpa Kamal Dahal have decided to bury the hatchet. The six-member task force the two chairs had formed submitted its report on August 22, basically addressing the concerns of both the leaders–that Oli will lead the government for the full term and Dahal will have an “expanded role” as party chair. The party has called its Secretariat meeting for Saturday to discuss the task force’s report, which has made some other recommendations as well, including the party’s general convention in April and a Cabinet reshuffle. Party insiders say the two chairs have basically returned to the November 2019 deal, which said Oli would lead the government for full five years and Dahal would command the party. “There is nothing new in the task force report. Why does the party need a task force’s report just to suggest what the party chairs had already agreed back in November,” said a Standing Committee member who spoke on condition of anonymity. “It does not address the major concern of the party–establishment of the system.” Multiple leaders the Post spoke to said they were convinced that the factional feud in the party was neither for the party system nor for principles and that it was all for power and positions. They, however, stressed that they never wanted the party to split because of the rift between the top leaders. Until last month, the rift had widened between the two chairs to the extent that it looked like the party, formed in May 2018, was headed for a split. When Oli and Dahal announced the formation of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), born after the merger of then CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), they had declared themselves as the co-pilots. Since then, according to insiders, the party has by and large been run by the two chairmen; whenever the party has been in trouble, it’s because of the tussle between them.  Even when the fight between the two chairs was at its peak, the party’s second rung and youth leaders barely spoke. Most of the time, Oli and Dahal have been at the centre stage, with only a few leaders like Madhav Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal and Bamdev Gautam having their say. “In the Nepal Communist Party, the two chairs are the party,” said Prithvi Subba Gurung, a Standing Committee member and chief minister of Gandaki Province. “And this time around also, after the tussle reached the tipping point, they seem to have managed to find a middle path between them.” Though some leaders like Nepal and Khanal have expressed reservations about the task force report, party insiders say their discontent hardly matters when the two chairs have agreed to stand together. “We cannot please everyone,” said Pampha Bhusal, a Standing Committee member and a member of the task force. “Now things will gradually go to the Standing Committee as both chairs are positive about the report.” Besides Bhusal, the task force had Surendra Pandey, Bhim Rawal, Janardan Sharma and Shankar Pokhrel as members. Bhusal and Sharma represent former Maoists; Pandey and Rawal represent the Madhav Nepal faction while Poudel and Pokhrel are Oli’s close confidantes. Though the 17-page report has made several recommendations, it has explicitly made it clear that a lack of proper work division between the two chairs created mistrust and internal conflict among the top leadership.  “Recurring problems in the relations between two chairs had negatively affected the activities of the party and the government,” states the report. “Oli will lead the government for the full term and Dahal will focus on the party's works with the executive role.” Insiders say if the two chairs are in agreement, they can easily placate the Nepal-Khanal group with some changes in the ministerial portfolios. If need be, chief ministers could be changed, most probably in Bagmati and Province 5, according to the insiders. Political analysts say it is not surprising that the task force has given the party reins to the two chairs, as they are the ones who are going to make decisions at least until the general convention. “The two chairs have been decisive in almost everything since the party was born,” said Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst who has followed Nepal’s leftist politics for decades. “There is no alternative to consensus between the two chairs until the general convention, as the party unity is all about power sharing.” When the party unity was announced a little over two years ago, there were concerns from within the two constituent parties if “true unification” was possible as they came from two different schools of thought with their ideologies poles apart. During the unification, the party had made an unprecedented decision that there would be two chairs, which too had raised quite an eyebrow, as both Oli and Dahal led their respective parties. While Oli had become UML chair through election, Dahal had led the Maoist party without opposition for the past three decades. Over the more than two years since the unification, if any problem has arisen in the party, it is mostly between the two chairs, with Nepal once in a while challenging the leadership, especially Oli, his bete noire since the UML days. Insiders say Nepal decided to side with Dahal not because he trusted the former Maoist leader but because he wanted to up the ante against Oli. There is no real fight between Oli and Nepal, as at the end of the day, what binds them together is their shared love-hate relationship, according to them. Leaders close to Oli say the discontent expressed by Nepal at the task force does not really matter. “Those who are opposing the formation of the task force must admit that they all were nominated by the two chairs,” said Subas Nembang, a Standing Committee member, one of Oli’s close confidantes. Krishna Pokhrel, who teaches political science at Tribhuvan University, said there was no way Dahal would have made any move that could lead the party to a split. “No one would have benefitted from the party split–neither Oli nor Dahal. There is no alternative for both to maintain the party unity,” Pokhrel told the Post.  Party leaders, however, are convinced that to save the party unity, the two chairs have to work in tandem, at least until the unity general convention.",Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/08/28/in-nepal-communist-party-the-two-chairs-are-the-party
28,NCP task force suggestion throws future of MCC into confusion,"August 25, 2020","The future of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact has once again been thrown into confusion.  The six-member task force assigned to suggest ways to minimise differences within the party recommended that the government ratify the compact with necessary amendments and modifications in favour of national interest.  But amendments to MCC compact is not possible, according to the US and this has already been communicated to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali, Finance Minister Yubraj Khatiwada and other senior officials of Nepal government, two knowledgeable sources told the Post.  While rejecting the prospect of an amendment or adjustment to the MCC compact, the US Embassy in Kathmandu said in an email response: “The U.S. Embassy continues to stand ready to provide clarifications where necessary. In August 2017, Nepal and MCC negotiated the Compact in good faith. The Compact negotiations included careful analysis of each compact provision by representatives of Nepal and MCC. “  The task force also suggested discussing both the MCC compact agreement and an internal report submitted by former prime minister Jhalanath Khanal at the party Secretariat and Standing Committee meetings before taking the final decision. Meanwhile, the US government has stopped releasing funds from the $500 million grant assistance under the MCC Compact that the two governments signed in 2017, as Nepal failed to ratify the agreement from Parliament within the June 30 deadline.  The grant would be the largest single grant in Nepal’s history and fund two 400KV transmission line projects—Lapsiphedi-Ratmate-Hetauda and Lapsiphedi-Ratmate-Damauli— and maintenance of around 300 kilometres of roads on the East-West Highway. The House of Representatives could not ratify the compact in June because the anti-Oli factions within the party were against it, and the prime minister’s position looked shaky within the party.  A section of ruling party leaders says House ratification of the US programme in its existing form undermines Nepal’s sovereignty and it has been demanding some amendments to the agreement. Those in the ruling party opposing the MCC also argue that the programme is part of the US-led Indo-Pacific Strategy aimed at ‘containing China’. Some have also taken exception to a clause in the MCC agreement that says the compact will prevail over existing Nepali laws. The Ministry of Finance, while citing the unprecedented situation emerged after Covid-19 pandemic, had written to MCC headquarters requesting an extension to programme until the next Parliament session convenes, which the MCC headquarters had already agreed to.  “The US Embassy looks forward to the Government of Nepal ratifying the compact as signed,” the embassy said in an email on Monday.  With other pressing issues within the party, the task force that submitted its report to party co-chairs Oli and Dahal on Saturday has not dwelt at length on the compact.  “We did not discuss much on what to do regarding the MCC compact and largely left the issue to the discretion of the government,” Surendra Pandey, a member of the task force, told the Post. The task force has reiterated the same old position of the ruling party, two senior government officials said, and it is neither flexible nor rigid, but it has largely left the party and government to take a call.  “The MCC pact is approved by the US Senate so it is impossible to make changes or amend it,” Rameshwor Khanal, a former finance secretary, told the Post. “The MCC pact cannot be amended only for Nepal.”  The MCC is an aid agency under the US government and the MCC compact is a large, five-year grant programme under which the fund is provided to the countries that pass the MCC’s eligibility criteria.  “The same terms, conditions and negotiations apply to Nepal and other receiving countries,” said Khanal. “The US government or its embassy may clarify if there are some confusions.”  Only through a supplementary exchange or through the letter of exchange, the US government, upon the request from the government of Nepal, will clarify the confusion but modification or amendment of the MCC compact is not possible, the two officials from two different ministries who are directly handing the US assistance, told the Post.  After Nepal failed to ratify the compact through Parliament at the end of June, the United States said that availability of the funding under the Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact Programme was not open-ended and whether to accept the grant under the programme was Nepal’s choice. “Tangible, near-term steps in Nepal are necessary to ensure the continued viability of the programme,” said the US embassy in Kathmandu in June. A ruling party leader said that politically speaking, the party is in a difficult position due to the MCC. But it is also a fact that Nepal should not lose out on such a huge grant in this time of a pandemic.  With the United States government withholding the funds that were to be released through a project implementation agreement, Nepal is putting in the money to execute the project including providing salaries and remuneration to the staff, according to the Nepal office of the MCC.  According to Khanal, it looks like the ruling party is looking for further explanation from the American side on security issues, like the MCC is not part of Indo-Pacific Strategy, the MCC does not have provisions of stationing the US Army, and on the issue of patent rights.

29,"Despite call for changes in Nepali Congress, old guard clings on to power","August 23, 2020","With the old guard in the Nepali Congress refusing to let go of its position and the youth ranks not strong enough to challenge them, the grand old party of Nepali politics still seems to be finding its feet to make itself relevant again. With six months to go for the general convention, which is to choose a new leadership, several senior leaders have thrown their hats in the ring and are trying to forge alliances to ensure their win.  “On the one hand, the number of candidates is increasing and alliances are being built,” said Puranjan Acharya, a long time Nepali Congress watcher. “On the other, the new generation has failed to claim the new leadership.”  Party leaders and political commentators say old faces, who have expressed their intent to contest for the party presidency, seem to be fighting for their personal legacies, and not for changes in terms of organisation, and political ideology or to enthuse fresh ideas into the party.  So far besides the incumbent Sher Bahadur Deuba, 74, senior leader Ram Chandra Poudel,, 75, vice president Bimalendra Nidhi,63, general secretary Shashanka Koirala, 61, Krishna Prasad Situala, 71, Shekhar Koirala,69, and Prakash Man Singh,64 have expressed their intent to fight for the leadership.  Two more leaders, Ram Sharan Mahat,69, and Arjun Nar Singh KC, 72, have also expressed their desire to contest.  Following the humiliating defeat at the hands of the Left Alliance during the 2017 general elections, in which the party won 23 seats of 165 in the first-past-the-post system and 40 of the 110 seats in the proportional representation system, leaders have been calling for a fundamental change in the way the party is run.  “Principle is the important, not the leader. Institutions are important, systems are important. So we need change in the party. We have to inject fresh momentum in the party. So we have to rethink our policy related to economic, social and economic agenda and ending corruption should be the priority,” said Ajun Narsingh KC.  Freshness can only come into the party if the Nepali Congress gets rid of the present leadership, said Acharya.   “I see a lot of suffocation inside the party,” he told the Post.  One hope is the youth to take over, but that looks far-fetched, he said.  If youth leaders come up with a consensus and form a team, then youth leader Gagan Thapa has also expressed his intent to contest the elections.  “But our generation is confused. It's a question of capability and self- confidence to lead the party and the nation. We youths have no clear-cut mission and vision,” said Nabindra Raj Joshi, a youth leader. “Therefore like in the past, we will continue to remain in the shadows of the older generation.”  For the older leaders, this is the last chance for them to land the top job in the party as they will be unable to fight the next leadership election due to the unwritten understanding that those above 70 will not seek leadership roles.  They are therefore forging up alliances. At present, Deuba is on one side and on the other his challengers. But Deuba’s position has become shaky with long-time ally Bimalendra Nidhi joining the fray.  Nidhi, Deuba’s trusted lieutenant in the party, was appointed vice president for his support during the last general convention held in March 2016. “I have made my position clear to Deuba that I will contest because he promised me last time that he would support me,” Nidhi told the Post. “I can’t wait as next time, a new generation will come up to claim the leadership.”  All eyes are on how the Deuba-Nidhi alliance plays out.  One party leader told the Post if Nidhi decides to go against Deuba, he will pose a serious challenge to him and Deuba may not get elected for a second term.  “Nidhi’s decision to fight for the presidency is important because he holds a strong vote bank for Deuba in Tarai,” said Joshi. “If Nidhi contests, it will be a big loss for Deuba. On the other hand if Deuba is reluctant to support Nidhi, then Nidhi himself will reach out to others.”  Nidhi has already sent feelers to other influential leaders in the party. “I have expressed my desire to contest the elections to other top leaders,” Nidhi told the Post.  It's not a question of legacy, serving as the President of Nepal Student Union to the party's vice president, I am capable of bringing change so I am determined to fight for arty president, said Nidhi. Sources inside the party said that attempts are also underway to create different alliances. This would include a compromise between the two Koiralas and then between the Koiralas, Nidhi and Singh.  While Shaskhank is BP Koirala’s son, Shekhar is his cousin. Singh is the son of Ganesh Man Singh and Nidhi of Mahendra Narayan Nidhi. All three were first generation leaders of the Nepali Congress.  Another possible alliance that is being touted is one that will field a leader below 70 (such Nidhi, Singh or Koirala) as president and someone from the youth ranks like Gagan Thapa, Pradeep Poudel or Bishwa Prakash Sharma as general secretary.  Poudel, Deuba’s bete noire, and his camp has half a dozen aspirants and they are quietly following developments in the Deuba and Nidhi camps. Attempts are also underway to send Deuba and Poudel into retirement and bring in a new leadership on the basis of consensus or to set the stage for a fight between a limited number of candidates.  Many party leaders think that like previous elections, this time too the vote for the party president will go into the second round if no one gets a clear majority in the first and the candidates with wider support base will fight the second round—probably Deuba and someone else.  The party needs an overhaul in its organisational structure, leadership and ideology to cope with new emerging challenges, said Acharya.

A reshuffle of the Cabinet and changes in the provincial governments run by the party have also been suggested, a task force member said.  “The demand for Oli’s resignation has now subsided,” said a member of the task force. “Now the stalled Standing Committee will discuss the suggestions and endorse them, with or without corrections.” The party must work on convening its national convention to seal the merger between the then UML and the Maoist party as scheduled by the Central Committee, and endorse the Millennium Challenge Corporation compact as suggested by the panel formed to look into it, he added, requesting anonymity. The panel has also suggested the party to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. The six-member task force handed its report to the co-chairs on Saturday despite Dahal’s concerns over political nominations the Oli Cabinet made last week without consulting the party. The report will be presented before the party’s Secretariat along with the opinion of the two chairpersons, and then to the ongoing Standing Committee meeting, which remains stalled since July 28.  The long-standing dispute within the party over Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s conduct and demands that he step down either from the post of co-chair or prime minister had made leaders scramble to save party unity. It had also affected governance.  There are also differences within the party over the ratification of the Millennium Challenge Corporation Nepal Compact with Oli calling in favour of ratification and the opposition faction calling for a revision of the agreement before its ratification.  The task force has also suggested that the recommendations of the three-member committee led by senior leader Jhalanath Khanal be endorsed. The committee had suggested that the compact shouldn’t be ratified in its present form.  “Now the report will be discussed at the party’s secretariat and Standing Committee,”said Bishnu Sapkota, press advisor to Dahal The six-member panel led by party general secretary Bishnu Poudel comprised two members each from the three factions in the party.

31,Parliamentary Secretariat refuses to entertain lawmaker Rauniyar’s application seeking explanation for his suspension,"August 20, 2020","The Parliamentary Secretariat has refused to register an application by suspended lawmaker Hari Narayan Rauniyar seeking update on his earlier application demanding explanation behind his suspension. Rauniyar was suspended as a lawmaker after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority on October 5, 2018 filed a corruption case against his construction firm for substandard work in a bridge project. Following his dismissal, Rauniyar had registered an application at the Parliamentary Secretariat on December 1, 2018, seeking explanation why he was suspended. He had argued that his suspension was against the regulation of the House of Representatives. On Tuesday, Rauniyar had tried to register a right to information application, seeking an update on the state of his previous application.  The Parliament Secretariat, however, refused to entertain Rauniyar’s application, arguing that the case concerning him and his company, Pappu Construction, is still under investigation.  The secretariat cannot accept his application until the corruption case reaches its conclusion, Dashrath Dhamala, information officer of the federal Parliament, told the Post.  “As long as Rauniyar is not cleared of the corruption charge, neither Parliament nor the Parliamentary Secretariat can do anything about his application,” said Dhamala.  The snub has not gone down well with Rauniyar.  “Every citizen has the right to information as per the constitution, but the General Secretary of Parliament Secretariat, Bharat Raj Gautam, violated my constitutional right by refusing to register my application,” said Rauniyar.He said his case was an issue of public concern because he was a lawmaker elected by the people in his constituency.  Rauniyar also claimed that under the Rule 244 (3) of the House of Representatives Regulation, he should be allowed to continue as a lawmaker.  Ther rule states that a lawmaker’s pay, perks and privileges will be suspended when s/he is in custody on criminal charges. A lawmaker remains suspended until the period of imprisonment once convicted by the court. “I am neither in custody nor in prison, I should not have been suspended,” Rauniyar told the Post.  But Dhamala, the information officer of the federal parliament, disagrees with Rauniyar’s contention.  He said Rauniyar lost his seat in the House of Representatives under a separate anti-corruption law that automatically disqualifies an individual holding public post for corruption charge.  On October 5, 2018, the anti-graft body had filed a corruption case at the Special Court against Rauniyar and his son Sumit for building a substandard bridge over the Babai river in Jabbighat, Bardiya. The bridge built by the Pappu Construction had collapsed in 2017 before it could be formally handed over to the Department of Roads.  It was the first time a serious action was taken against Pappu Construction, which had earlier avoided government action despite dismal performance on the projects handled by the company. Even as a majority of the projects under Pappu Construction were running behind schedule, the company had managed to evade inquiries and penalties due to Ruaniyar’s political clout and connections.  The corruption case against Rauniyar emerged as a key turning point not only for his political career but also for the fate of his own company.  Rauniyar continues to remain suspended from the post of lawmaker while his firm has been blacklisted by the Public Procurement Monitoring Office, five times in the last one and half years, for underperformance in five construction projects. A blacklisted firm cannot take part in any government bids for maximum three years as per the Public Procurement Act. Even before Pappu Construction was formally blacklisted, the company was denied the contract of over Rs 2billion to construct the building of Nepal Rastra Bank in Baluwatar, Kathmandu. In March last year, the Public Procurement Monitoring Office had blacklisted Coastal Pappu JV, a joint venture firm, which was awarded the contract to construct the main and link canals and rehabilitation of headworks of the Dunduwa Irrigation System, under the Sikta Irrigation Project.  The joint contract was annulled citing poor progress in the implementation of the project. The JV was also barred from participating in government bids for the next three years. The procurement monitoring office also blacklisited Raman Pappu JV last year for one year for failing to deliver the promised works on a postal highway project.  Raman is currently involved in the restoration project of Dharahara in Kathmandu. Pappu was also blacklisted for three years in February this year for failing to build a bridge over the Bagmati river in Tinkune, Kathmandu.  According to the Postal Highway Directorate, Pappu/Bamti JV was blacklisted for one year in July and Pappu/Nepal Pragati was blacklisted for three years that same month as per the request of Mid-Hill Highway Project Directorate. The Public Procurement Monitoring Office is still in the process of deciding whether to blacklist Runiyar’s company as per the request made by two government entities.

32,Conflict in ruling party hits governance hard,"August 19, 2020","When the novel coronavirus, first detected in Wuhan last year, started to spread across the globe, governments sprung into action. The World Health Organisation on January 30 declared the outbreak a public health emergency. The first case was reported in Nepal in January. It was during that time the ruling Nepal Comumunist Party was embroiled in a conflict over the selection of House Speaker.  Two days after the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Nepal, Agni Sapkota was elected Speaker after weeks-long tug of war between party chairs KP Sharma Oli, also the prime minister, and Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Immediately after, the party held its Central Committee meeting, which was overshadowed by disputes over the Millenium Challenge Corporation.  On March 4, Oli underwent his second kidney transplant. A day earlier, the government formed a high-level committee to fight Covid-19. Oli got hospitalised but he did not appoint an officiating prime minister, raising concerns over how the government would respond in case of a virus spread. Oli had a successful kidney transplant. The country escaped virus spread. When infections were soaring in various countries, the government imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 24. Nepal had reported just two Covid-19 cases. Public health experts have long argued that the government failed to utilise the lockdown period for preparations to fight the pandemic. During the lockdown, the ruling party, instead, was in the midst of a conflict over Oli’s resignation. Minister for Labour, Employment and Social Security Rameswor Raya Yadav agreed that the government couldn’t properly focus on combating Covid-19.  “Due to the uncertain situation following the internal wrangling in the party, we could not focus on combating Covid-19 with high self-confidence,” he told the Post.  Analysts say at a time when countries across the world were employing their medical wherewithal and political will to fight the virus, in Nepal, the ruling party was engaged in infighting. “If there is a conflict within the party that is governing the country, governance tends to get seriously affected,” said Bimal Koirala, a former chief secretary. “Bureaucrats don’t want to take risks by making decisions when the political situation is fluid.” The lockdown was lifted on July 21–by that time the number of Covid-19 cases in the country had crossed the 17,000 mark.  The country today has over 28,257 Covid-19 cases, with 114 deaths.  While the government had a lethargic response to the pandemic, corruption cases emerged, making matters worse. The prime minister continued to make light of the virus threat–at times saying Covid-19 is not killing people in Nepal while other times he encouraged people to drink water with turmeric. In June-end, when the country reported a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases, a faction in the ruling party was baying for Oli’s blood, demanding his resignation both as party chair and prime minister. As the Dahal faction upped the ante, Oli, along with his ministers, was busy planning ways to resist pressure to resign.  “The Oli-led government completely lost the plot when it came to fighting the pandemic,” said Shyam Shrestha, a political analyst. “The internal conflict in the party led to knee-jerk actions rather than studied decisions.” According to Shrestha, corruption cases with allegations that even health and defence ministers were involved exposed the Oli administration’s poor governance.  “The Oli Cabinet lost its focus due to the internal conflict in the party,” said Shrestha. After corruption cases were reported, the Cabinet on March 29 decided to purchase medical equipment to fight the virus under a government-to-government deal. The army was roped in. But it took months for the equipment to arrive.  Meanwhile, Nepalis in large numbers from India started to return home. Since the borders were sealed, they were stranded on the other side of the border. Desperate to enter home, many used alternate routes to enter. Quarantine facilities set up near border areas by the government were so poor that public health experts doubted if they could help contain the virus.  As internal conflict grew in the party, Oli on April 20 introduced two ordinances–one related to party split and registration of a new party–aiming to use it as a weapon to tackle his opponents in the party. After much criticism that the ordinances were uncalled for at a time when the government should have been fighting the pandemic, Oli decided to withdraw them within five days. On April 29, party leaders demanded Oli’s resignation at the Secretariat meeting. In May, the Oli government’s focus shifted to border issues with India after the latter inaugurated a road link via Lipulekh to Kailash Mansarovar in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. As Covid-19 caess continued to rise, Oli found refuge in a new Nepali political map. The decision to publish a new map and subsequently get endorsed by Parliament drew huge support from parties across the spectrum. The Parliament approved the new map depicting Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as Nepali territories on June 13. The Oli government then sat on the laurels of publishing the new map, as virus cases showed no signs of abating. The conflict in the ruling party also escalated and on June 29, the party’s Standing Committee convened, with around 30 members once again demanding Oli’s resignation both as party chair and prime minister. A Cabinet minister, who represents the opposition faction in the party, conceded that the party’s internal conflict hugely affected the works of the ministries.  “It’s obvious. We all know the nature of our society, bureaucracy and culture,” the minister told the Post who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing reprisal.  The minister did not elaborate.  “Nepali bureaucrats are highly politicised,” said Koirala, the former chief secretary. “Instead of taking decisions and implementing policies they are more interested in pleasing political leaders. Even ministers could not take decisions with their positions insecure.”  Many of the ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister Ishwor Pokhrel, Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, Energy Minister Barshaman Pun, Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali, Agriculture Minister Ghanashyam Bhusal, Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai, Health Minister Bhanubhakta Dhakal and Forest Minister Shakti Basnet were engaged in various meetings to manage the party conflict. All these ministers, except Dhakal, are Standing Committee members of the party.",Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/08/19/conflict-in-ruling-party-hits-governance-hard
33,"Nepal, India resume dialogue, but ties far from normal, say experts","August 17, 2020","Senior officials from Nepal and India reopened formal lines of communication on Monday, months after boundary-related issues strained ties. A discussion on the status of India-funded projects in Nepal between the two sides via video conferencing on Monday marked the first major bilateral dialogue between the two neighbours after Kathmandu released a new political map of Nepal incorporating some territories administered by India.  The resumption of formal talks between the two countries bodes well for bilateral ties, but it’s not sufficient to normalise relations or to resolve the boundary row that has persisted for decades, former foreign ministers and diplomats told the Post.  “The meeting is a positive step towards ending the deadlock, but this is not enough. It will take some more time—even months and years—to settle difficult issues such as that of the boundary,” said former ambassador to India, Lokraj Baral. “India and China are talking even in the midst of heightened tensions, so why should Nepal and India not talk ? A single issue can’t put the entire ties in a bind,” said Baral.  Relations between the two countries hit a low after Nepal published a new political map placing Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura within its borders in response to India's announcement of a road link via Lipulekh to Kailash Mansarovar in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Both Kathmandu and Delhi expressed willingness to hold dialogue on the issue, but that had not materialised. Monday’s meeting came two day after a telephone conversation between Prime Minister Oli and his Indian counterpart.  Oli called Modi on Saturday to congratulate India on its 74th Independence Day and said, “Nepal looks forward to a meaningful cooperation between Nepal and India.”  The meeting and the telephone conversation signal that the two sides have reached an understanding that the entire gamut of bilateral ties should not be held hostage to a single issue, and that both sides have agreed to resume talks, two officials at Prime Minister Office and Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post. If both sides avoid irritating each other, more meetings can take place, and finally foreign secretaries of the two countries can talk about the boundary dispute, the officials added.  The understanding was reached as Prime Minister Oli used “several back channels”— formal, informal, and even religious ones to talk to Indian officials on resumption of dialogue, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, former foreign minister and spokesperson for the ruling party told the Post. He said that talks on the boundary issue may not take place soon. “ It took several attempts to break the jogjam. I don’t see ties with India returning to normal anytime soon,” said Shrestha. “Although official meetings are good gestures, I don’t think everything with our relations with India is on the right track.”  Monday’s meeting of the oversight mechanism, co-chaired by Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi and Indian Ambassador to Nepal Vinay Mohan Kwatra, underlined the need to expedite the implementation of the bilateral projects and agreed to undertake necessary measures to address their problems and obstacles. Discussions were held on the status of ongoing projects under Nepal-India bilateral cooperation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Projects such as Tarai roads, cross-border railway, Arun-III Hydropower Project, petroleum pipeline and Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project were discussed during the video conference meeting, the ministry said.  Post-earthquake reconstruction, irrigation, power and transmission lines, construction of Nepal Police Academy, integrated check posts, the Ramayana circuit, motorable bridges over Mahakali River, agriculture and cultural heritage were also taken up,, according to the ministry. Former Ambassador Baral said that the meeting indicates that ties will be normalised gradually, but Nepali leaders should tread cautiously. “It is the responsibility of Nepali to refrain from making unnecessary comments on bilateral ties that could further invite tensions,” he added.  Meanwhile, officials said not all India-funded projects are doing well in Nepal as projects such as the Arun III hydroelectric project have a dismal track record. Due to Covid pandemic, several projects are facing obstacles and might not meet their completion deadlines.  According to a study carried out by Brookings India on two India-funded projects (The East-West Postal road and the Jogbani-Biratnagar cross-border railway line), they are facing a myriad of challenges, including the acquisition of land.

34,Ruling party Secretariat endorses task force formed to resolve ongoing conflict,"August 17, 2020","The Secretariat meeting of the Nepal Communist Party has endorsed the decision to form a six-member task force to resolve the ongoing conflict in the ruling party. A meeting of the two chairs–KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal–on Friday decided to form the task force led by General Secretary Bishnu Poudel to prepare a proposal for resolving the outstanding issues. Three senior leaders Madhav Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal and Narayan Kaji Shrestha, however, had questioned the process of the formation of the task force and demanded that the task force must be validated by a party committee. Endorsement of the task force by the Secretariat on Monday now has paved the way for it to start its work, according to Shrestha, the party spokesperson.  Shrestha said no timeframe has been given to the task force yet to come up with its recommendations on ways to resolve the internal disputes and running the party and the government. The ruling party has been vertically divided between the two factions led by Oli and Dahal. The Dahal faction had been demanding that Oli resign both as prime minister and party chair. Oli had refused. After a series of negotiations between Oli and Dahal, the two chairs on Friday decided to form the task force, with two members each from their factions and as many from the Nepal group. The task force includes Poudel and Shankar Pokhrel from the Oli faction and Janardan Sharma and Pampha Bhusal from the Dahal camp. Bhim Rawal and Surendra Pandey represent the Nepal faction.  “We are hopeful that the party’s conflict will be settled within a few days,” Shrestha said. The ruling party is also mulling a Cabinet reshuffle as part of a large power sharing deal among the factions led by Oli, Dahal and Nepal.",Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/08/17/ruling-party-secretariat-endorses-task-force-formed-to-resolve-ongoing-conflict
35,"In bid to manage party conflict, Oli plans Cabinet reshuffle as part of larger deal with Dahal","August 17, 2020","After weeks of wrangling, ruling Nepal Communist Party chairs KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal appear to have reached a tactical understanding, and to manage the ongoing conflict a Cabinet reshuffle is on the cards as part of a “package deal”. The ruling party, for the past few months, has been in a crisis with the faction led by Dahal, backed by senior leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal, demanding Oli’s resignation both as party chair and prime minister. As Oli and Dahal resumed talks after a break of nine days on August 13, the party, a day later, decided to form a six-member task force to suggest ways to resolve the conflict. The task force has two members each from Oli, Dahal and Nepal sides. According to insiders, just as the task force begins its work, exercises will start to address the concerns of the Dahal-Nepal faction so as to resolve the ongoing disputes. “As per my understanding, the task force will provide a blueprint to the party leadership for resolving the conflict after which at least one round of Cabinet reshuffle will take place,” Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali, who is also a Standing Committee member, told the Post. “The task force is likely to submit its report by Tuesday.” The party has called a Secretariat meeting on Monday morning. The meeting is expected to endorse the formation of the six-member panel led by Poudel and finalise its mandate. Factional feud in the ruling party had deepened until last month with the Dahal-Nepal faction refusing to make any concession less than Oli’s resignation. As many as 31 out of the 44 Standing Committee members had demanded that Oli step down both as party chair and prime minister. Oli, however, forced Dahal into sitting for talks, and the two held a series of one-on-one meetings starting July 2. Nepal and Khanal attended two meetings between Oli and Dahal, but separately. But talks suddenly broke down after Oli said that he would not resign and asked the Dahal faction “to do whatever they can”. At one point, leaders from the Dahal faction were ready to force a decision against Oli and take it to the Central Committee. Over 150 central members had even demanded a Central Committee meeting. Oli, however, kept on postponing the Standing Committee, where the Dahal-Nepal faction holds a majority, and in the meantime managed to win over party vice-chair Bamdev Gautam, suddenly tipping the balance in the Secretariat. Insiders say the task force may present a proposal, which could also include names of those to be inducted in the Cabinet. Change in chief ministers in some provinces, probably Bagmati and Province 5, also cannot be ruled out to placate all the factions, especially the Nepal group, according to insiders. According to a leader who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying the development is in a preliminary state, Dahal has made “some kind” of agreement with both Nepal and Khanal. “A Cabinet reshuffle as well as some changes in provinces and some political appointments are likely,” said the leader. “If agreed upon by all, Oli could induct Gautam into the Cabinet as deputy prime minister.” Two chief ministers may be recalled to adjust those recommended by the Dahal-Nepal faction, according to the leader.  Insiders say party spokesperson Shrestha too has been laying claim to a deputy prime minister position along with a ministerial portfolio. According to leaders from the Oli and Dahal camps, at least 10 new faces could make it to the Cabinet. It was not immediately clear what exactly is the deal between Oli and Dahal about themselves, as all other arrangements, including the Cabinet reshuffle, are aimed at managing other conflicts. The larger deal which Oli and Dahal seem to have reached, according to some leaders, is that Oli will continue as prime minister and Dahal will lead the party as executive chairman until the general convention. This deal is in line with the November 2019 understanding, which said Oli could lead the government for the full term and Dahal would run the party. Until the general convention, Dahal will chair meetings of the Secretariat, Standing Committee and Central Committee and will take charge of the preparations related to the unity convention, including the ideological debate. There, however, is no clarity on when the general convention will be held–as leaders are mullig November/December and March/April dates. “The infighting in the party in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and natural disasters has sent a negative message among the people,” said Raghuji Pant, a Standing Committee member close to Nepal. “Party leadership has agreed to iron out the differences so that the government and the party can focus on the challenges that the nation is currently facing.” According to Pant, the party leadership is close to settling disputes and the task force is going to assist in addressing the concerns of all factions.

36,Ruling party forms six-member task force for dispute resolution,"August 14, 2020","The ruling Nepal Communist Party has decided to form a six-member task force “to resolve” disputes in the party. According to a member of the task force, the taskforce led by General Secretary Bishnu Poudel has Standing Committee members Shankar Pokhrel, Janardan Sharma, Bhim Rawal, Surendra Pandey and Pampha Bhusal. The decision to form the task force was taken on Friday after a meeting between party chairs KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal who resumed their talks on Thursday after a hiatus of nine days. “I was informed about the task force by General Secretary Poudel,” said Rawal, a member of the task force. “I have no idea about the terms of reference.” After both Oli and Dahal hardened their positions, both leaders had not met for nine days until Thursday.  The ruling party is currently vertically divided with Oli and Dahal leading two factions. The Dahal faction, backed by senior leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal, had been demanding that Oli resign both as party chair and prime minister for failing to run the party and the government. Oli, however, had refused to budge. Among the six leaders in the task force, Poudel and Pokhrel are close to Oli while Sharma and Bhusal are close to Dahal and Rawal and Pandey are close to senior leader Madhav Nepal.

37,12 Congress leaders urge Deuba to scrap decision to form party departments,"August 12, 2020","Twelve youth leaders of the Nepali Congress on Tuesday urged party President Sher Bahadur Deuba to scrap his decision to form various party departments. Despite repeated warnings from rival factions led by Ram Chandra Poudel and Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Deuba has kept on forming party departments. He has nominated over 668 cadres for them as of Monday. The party has already announced to hold its general convention in February, 2021. By Tuesday, Deuba has formed 15 departments in spite of strong opposition from party members. The party’s code of conduct bars any nomination after announcement of the date for general convention. The youth leaders mostly belong to the Poudel and Sitaula factions of the party. They urged Deuba to respect the party charter and withdraw the nominations made for various departments and end the culture of factional politics, according to a joint statement. The signatories are Chandra Bhandari, Dhanraj Gurung, Gururaj Ghimire, Gagan Thapa, Badri Pandey, Ratna Serchan, Pradip Poudel, Jeevan Pariyar, Ram Krishna Yadav, Kiran Yadav, Sarita Prasai and Kamala Pant. At a time when the conventions of various party committees have been scheduled, the formation of departments has raised serious questions over the impartiality of the general convention, they said. Since the party president is the patron of the party charter, he should respect it and make others comply with the rules, the Congress leaders said. It is the role of party President Deuba to maintain democracy within the party and to ensure that the party follows the system. They argue that Deuba should make the leadership handover process acceptable to all. The party charter allows a maximum of 50 members in one department. Deuba is preparing to form seven more departments soon, according to Congress leaders. If the Poudel faction does not come to a consensus, Deuba is preparing to form all 42 departments unilaterally. In the process, he’ll assign roles to over 2,200 party leaders, a central member said. Poudel can object to the delay in forming the party departments but he cannot stop the process, the leader said. As per the party charter, all the departments should have been formed within six months of the general convention, which was held in 2016. However, Deuba never formed them on time but rushed to set them up after the term and mandate of the Central Working Committee was extended by one year for holding the party’s 14th general convention. When Poudel and other leaders urged Deuba to stop the nominations, Deuba reportedly said that he was following the footsteps of Girija Prasad Koirala and Sushil Koirala, arguing that they had done the same.",Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/08/12/12-congress-leaders-urge-deuba-to-scrap-decision-to-form-party-departments
38,Nepal braces for a return to locked-down life as rise in Covid-19 cases rings alarm bells,"August 12, 2020","Three weeks after lifting the lockdown, the federal government has given local administrations and governments the authority to decide on restrictions and lockdown measures as Covid-19 cases continue to rise. “The districts with more than 200 active cases of coronavirus can impose necessary restrictions. We have not imposed the nationwide lockdown and the Cabinet has decided not to,” said Finance and Information and Communication Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada, making public the government’s decisions on Covid-19 containment on Tuesday. The restriction orders, however, could lead to similar situations as lockdown at some places, according to Khatiwada. Other containment measures include restrictions on domestic and international passenger flights until August 31. The government had announced on July 20 that flights, both domestic and international, would be allowed from August 17. Long distance buses will now be allowed to ply from September 1.  All educational institutions including schools, colleges, tuition centres and training centres will remain closed. No date for their opening has been announced.  The government on July 20 had said schools could take admissions from August 17 but according to the announcement on Tuesday this has been pushed back by 15 days. Restaurants have been limited to takeaway services and all non-essential services like salons, shopping malls, theatres must remain closed, according to the new government directive.  Hotels were told to prepare for guests as international flights had been earlier scheduled to start arriving from August 17, but that too has been pushed back by 15 days.  “After assessing the risk, the local administrations and local units can take the necessary decisions,” said Khatiwada, who is also the government spokesperson. The government’s unplanned and abrupt decision to cover up for its shortcomings, however, has worried many. “We [hoteliers] are increasingly worried about the future. There are holes in the government’s Covid-19 response plan and we are becoming the long-term sufferers,” said Binayak Shah, senior vice president of the Hotel Association of Nepal. “We were asked to resume business, and accordingly we started bookings and had started calling employees back to work. Now we are in a dilemma. Our clients will not trust us anymore.” A senior official at the Home Ministry said that around 40 district administrations and local governments have already imposed various kinds of restrictions, lockdowns and curfews, and sealed border crossings since the lifting of the nationwide lockdown on July 21. There were demands on Sunday from mayors of Kathmandu Valley to seal all entry points to Kathmandu Valley and a total ban on public vehicles. But the Cabinet rejected the proposal, said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.  As of Tuesday, Nepal has reported 23,948 Covid-19 cases with 83 deaths. The Health Ministry said on Tuesday that 638 new cases and four deaths were confirmed in the last 24 hours. A total of 10,462 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were performed.  “The worry is that the numbers may increase further because several local bodies have reported that the coronavirus has spread in the community,” the official told the Post on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the media . Businesses want a proper plan and have described the government decision as “haphazard”.  “We started bookings as soon as the government asked us to restart the business. Now, the situation is uncertain again,” said Shah.  Another official from one domestic airline told the Post that they had sold over 20 percent of seats on sale in most of the sectors but things are uncertain now.  “We haven’t yet decided whether to refund or tell passengers to wait for another two weeks to travel. We are not sure what another decision could be. But it’s frustrating,” the official said, requesting anonymity as he doesn't want to openly criticise the government’s decision. Tourism Ministry Secretary Kedar Bahadur Adhikari told the Post that it’s not the ministry that makes decisions on when to allow the resumption of flights. “We follow the Coronavirus Crisis Management Committee’s directives,” he said. The Tourism Ministry has been told to prepare guidelines for testing, quarantine and other measures for tourists once the country is open.  “We are working on the guidelines,” said Adhikari.  Though Monday’s Cabinet meeting took a slew of decisions, the government stopped short of making them public the same day.  At least two ministers the Post spoke with said that the meeting decided to continue restrictions at all entry points to the country until September 16 midnight, except for goods and cargo movements and Nepalis returning home.  The meeting also decided to designate 10 entry points on the Nepal-India border for people’s movement. People were allowed to enter through 20 border points prior to the decision.  Government and private offices, banks, cooperatives, financial institutions and other organisations are allowed to mobilise only 50 percent of their employees in districts which have more than 200 coronavirus cases, as well as in Kathmandu Valley. Offices where services through online, virtual or electronic mediums are not possible should be closed until further decision, the Cabinet has decided. Buying and selling vegetables, fruits, clothes on footpaths and roadsides, open places, pushcarts and bicycles, and collection of scrap have been banned all over the country. The government has said that such activities could become leading causes of virus transmission.  Factories can operate only if they set up private quarantine ensuring strict health protocols for their workers. All large construction projects and industrial areas should provide food and shelter for their workers inside their premises.  Pashupati Murarka, former president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry who is also the owner of Murarka Organisation, told the Post on Monday that such provision may be possible only in big factories because they have enough spaces. “It may be an important decision considering the increase in Covid-19 cases but it’s not practical at all,” Murarka told the Post on Monday. All religious activities except daily worship at temples have been restricted. The government has said festivals should be observed among the family members at their homes following health protocols. International arrivals through passenger repatriation flights have been limited to 500 people—300 based on recommendations by diplomatic missions and 200 under the Foreign Employment Welfare Fund’s repatriation programme.  The arrivals will be quarantined in Kathmandu Valley and sent home once they test negative for the coronavirus.  The Health Ministry will take the responsibility to test returnees after five-seven days of their arrival. Travelling has been restricted to and from the districts with more than 200 infections except those with permission from respective District Covid-19 Crisis Management Centres and local governments.  Passes can be issued only for essential purposes, according to officials.",Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/08/12/nepal-braces-for-a-return-to-locked-down-life-as-rise-in-covid-19-cases-rings-alarm-bells
39,Nepali Congress likely to postpone its 14th general convention,"August 9, 2020","The Nepali Congress party is set to postpone its 14th general convention, slated for February next year, due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and lack of time to conduct elections in its lower units, according to party leaders. The official announcement of the postponement of the convention, which was to elect the new party leadership, is to be made after the Central Working Committee takes up the issue later in this month.  “It is almost certain that the general convention will be deferred to beyond April/May,” said Pradip Poudel, a central working committee member. “But it’s too early to announce it as the party leadership doesn’t want to be blamed for taking the decision on its own.”  The tenure of the Central Working Committee has already been extended by a year (until March), as per the party charter. If the party fails to elect a committee and form all local structures by March it can defer the general convention by another six months as per the party’s statute.  “The way Covid cases are increasing, we might defer the scheduled general convention for some weeks or even months, but our target to host the convention has not changed yet,” Ram Chandra Poudel, a senior party leader, told the Post.  The party, which recently embraced the federal setup, is yet to form interim structures to comply with the new arrangements in eight districts, most of them in the Tarai. Similarly, the party decided to launch a drive to double the number of active members from the present 4,98479.  But to distribute and verify the new active members’ list within mid-August is impossible, said another senior party leader. “That’s why we aren’t going to meet the February deadline.”  With spikes in Covid cases around the country and the imposition of lockdowns in at least 20 districts, several district units of the party have failed or are bound to fail to meet the deadline.  Some leaders, meanwhile, are saying that President Sher Bahadur Deuba doesn’t want to conduct the general convention soon. Deuba is in an aggressive mood, and it seems like he is not interested in the general convention, said senior party leader Dr Shekhar Koirala.  “Deuba wants to continue the status quo and he keeps on violating the party’s norms. He might be thinking that Prime Minister Oli will split the party and we will join the new government,”said Koirala. “If that happens, he thinks he can go into the convention with an advantage over his rivals. But that is not possible.” he added. Another senior party leader Krishna Prasad Situala has already proposed that the general convention be postponed until May/June next year.  “We still have time to assess the situation and decide on the dates for the convention,” said another leader.",Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/08/09/nepali-congress-likely-to-postpone-its-14th-general-convention
40,"As virus spreads, city to focus on contact tracing","September 6, 2020","The Kathmandu Metropolitan City has been coordinating with the federal government in the fight against Covid-19 due to the high infection caseload in the city compared to other parts of Kathmandu Valley.  The city officials said the KMC has only been focusing on contact tracing work while the federal government has been handling the jobs of managing and treating the infected patients.  “The city office has only been mobilising teams for contact tracing comprising ward representatives and health workers. Management and treatment of Covid-19 patients are being done by the federal government,” said Ishwor Man Dangol, spokesperson for KMC.  Dangol and two dozen KMC officials are currently in home isolation after Mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya tested positive for the coronavirus infection.  According to the Public Health Department of KMC, 3,277 people in Kathmandu had tested positive for the coronavirus infection as of Thursday. Of them, 935 are living in home isolation and 840 symptomatic patients are undergoing treatment in various hospitals. Twenty people had died of Covid-19 in Kathmandu as of Thursday.  The department data show that only 1,411 people had tested positive for the coronavirus infection in Kathmandu until the day after the three district administration offices in Kathmandu Valley enforced prohibitory orders starting August 20. In the past two weeks, an additional 1,866 people in Kathmandu have tested positive for the virus. Dr. Basudev Pandey, director at the chief of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, suspects that the virus has now entered the community transmission stage in Kathmandu.  “That is the reason for the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Kathmandu. One single house hosts over a dozen families so there is a high chance of the infection spreading from one family to the next,” said Pandey. “Besides, increased testing has also led to high infection numbers.”  The city till date has carried out a PCR test of 6,444 people. Health experts, however, say that the test numbers are not adequate, as Kathmandu City alone has a population of over 2 million, and all the 32 wards of the city have reported the coronavirus cases.  Infection numbers in Kathmandu Valley started surging by leaps and bounds ever since the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown was lifted after four months on July 21. Pandey said the number of cases began multiplying after the people from various coronavirus hotspots in the Tarai as well as India started entering the Valley post-lockdown.  Although public health experts had warned that the coronavirus cases could increase in the Valley, the authorities concerned did not place any measures to deal with a possible public health crisis. Mayor Shakya had drawn flaks, including from his own deputy Hari Prabha Khadgi, for not setting up quarantine and isolation centers to manage and treat the coronavirus patients. The mayor had responded to the criticism by blaming the federal government for allowing people to enter the Valley from various coronavirus hotspots. Following intense pressure from the public, Shakya, who also chairs the Kathmandu Valley Mayors’ Forum, on August 10 announced that he would build integrated isolation centers to accommodate 5,000 people. There is no sign of the promised integrated isolation centres till date.  “It is the duty of the mayor to take that initiative to save the people who voted for him. He cannot shirk his responsibility by passing the buck on the government,” said Deputy Mayor Khadgi.  Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, a virologist at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, said unless testing and contact tracing are ramped up the infection rate in Kathmandu was not going to decline.“There should be widespread testing during the restrictions period. Meanwhile, the public should also do their part by staying at home, observing social distancing, wearing masks while going out and washing their hands,” he said.  Meanwhile, Gyan Bahadur Oli, the Covid-19 focal person at KMC, said the city office was having trouble finding the contacts of infected people because many people are reluctant to reveal their identities due to the fear of social stigmation.  “We have over 350 people whose tests have come positive but we could not locate them as they had given the wrong personal details. They could be infecting other people,” said Oli.  Dangol, the KMC spokesperson, said the city was working hard by mobilising volunteers, public health officers and ward representatives to contain the coronavirus infection.",Valley,https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2020/09/06/as-virus-spreads-city-to-focus-on-contact-tracing
41,Lalitpur curfew lifted but gathering of over five people near Machhindranath chariot banned,"September 4, 2020","The curfew imposed in Lalitpur city area from 4am to 10 pm for Friday has been lifted but there are restrictions on the number of people near the Machhindranath chariot. A meeting held among the district security committee, Guthi Sansthan and other stakeholders to analyse Friday’s security status in the district decided to lift the curfew which had been imposed within the Ring Road of the district. “But we have banned the gathering of more than five people near the Pulchowk area,” said chief district officer Narayan Prasad Bhatta. “Our aim is not to let anyone be near the place where Machindranath chariot has been kept.” Priests conducted the Kshama Puja in front of the Rato Machindranath chariot on Friday following a decision of stakeholders on Thursday evening. After locals forcefully attempted to pull the chariot despite the prohibitory orders being in place, police on Thursday had fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd.  After the situation turned out to be more violent, some raged locals brutally beat up a traffic policeman,and several people including policemen were injured in clashes.  According to CDO Bhatta nine people involved in Thursday's brutal attack on a traffic police have been kept in custody and they are under further investigation.  Because of the administration’s late announcement of the curfew on Thursday night, many citizens were unaware of its decision. Many shops remained closed throughout the day with complete halt in public movement on Friday.

42,Health officials warn decision to allow shops to open till 11am could backfire,"September 4, 2020","The three district administration offices of Kathmandu Valley on Wednesday extended the prohibitory orders by a week while also deciding to allow shops to open till 11 am. Before this, shops selling food and other essential items were allowed to open only till 9 am.  The decision to widen the time frame was made considering the convenience of the public. However, some health experts have warned that this move could backfire as the coroanvirus cases in Kathmandu Valley have shown no signs of ebbing, even after the prohibitory orders were issued two weeks ago.  The Valley has been witnessing record spikes in the coronavirus cases in recent days and allowing people more time to be out in the public could undermine the efforts to lower the infection numbers, health officials warn.  “We are in a very difficult situation. It is also the responsibility of the people to bring down the infection rate by staying at their homes. They should stay at home to help the concerned authorities to minimise the public mobility so the virus does not spread,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, virologist at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital.  On Thursday morning, the Valley police had a difficult time managing the people who were out of their homes. Superintendent of Police Rameshwor Yadav, spokesperson for the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, said many people had come outside on the streets and neighbourhood alleys without valid reasons.  “People were out on their cars and motorcycles. When stopped and inquired about their purpose of being out, they would casually say that they were going to buy milk, to buy vegetables, or to meet their sick relatives at the hospital,” Yadav told the Post. “It was hard for the traffic officers to restrict their movement. Till 11 am, at least 600 motorists were booked. Allowing shops to open till 11am does not mean that the restrictions are also removed for vehicles.”  The government’s data show that 7,038 people have been infected with the coronavirus in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley— 5,622 in Kathmandu, 817 in Lalitpur and 599 in Bhaktapur—while 43 people have lost their lives till date. On Thursday, the country saw the highest single-day surge of the coronavirus cases with 1,228 new infections.  According to the Ministry of Health and Population, the total number of Covid-19 cases has readed 42,877 with 257 Covid-19 related fatalities.  While the Valley authorities have issued prohibitory orders in a bid to lower the infection rates, a large number of people descended on the street of Pulchowk in Lalitpur on Thursday for the Rato Machhindranath chariot-pulling festival.  When police intervened, the revellers clashed with the security personnel. Dr Pun and several other health experts have long been warning the government and the public to avoid large gatherings. ",Valley,https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2020/09/04/health-officials-warn-decision-to-allow-shops-to-open-till-11am-could-backfire
43,Authorities caught unawares of protests despite calls for allowing the Machhindranath chariot festival,"September 4, 2020","Around 10 am on Thursday, around 100 people gathered near the chariot of Rato Machhindranath to protest the authorities’ turning a blind eye to the festival. But soon, despite prohibitory orders being in place, 100 became 200 and within a couple of hours, there were over 500 people assembled in Pulchowk, dime baja and bhusya in hands, urging people to pull the chariot of the rain god. “The people you see here came because of their faith. We didn’t have to call anyone. They came here out of their own free will,” said Rabi Shakya, a local from Patan. But things quickly turned ugly. Despite repeated warnings by the police, locals continued to protest, and pull the chariot.  A clash between the locals and the police force ensued, with police using tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd. Locals resorted to stone pelting. Several people were injured including the police.  “Since people had arrived in huge numbers, police alone were unable to control the crowd,” said Senior Superintendent Tek Prasad Rai, chief of Lalitpur Metropolitan Police Range. “So we sought the help of the Armed Police Force.” In the aftermath of the clash, the chariot of Karuranamaya lay in the middle of the road, tilted dangerously, less than a 100 metres from where it was kept for nearly two months, surrounded by Armed Police Force personnel and the red bricks that now lay strewn on the street. Within a few hours, the atmosphere at Pulchowk turned from euphoric to something that has never been seen before at a major festival in the Kathmandu Valley.  But what happened in Patan on Thursday was not just a matter of frustrated locals wanting to celebrate a festival. It was a culmination of a series of events that started since the lockdown that prohibited Patan locals from observing one of their most important festivals.  Chief District Officer of Lalitpur Narayan Prasad Bhatta said that they had not imagined that the situation would escalate as much as it had and put the blame on ""irresponsible groups"" for causing tension.  “We never expected something like this would happen,” Bhatta told the Post.  Chandra Maharjan, who coordinates the festival, said there was a meeting going on with stakeholders when they heard that people were pulling the chariot.  “We were not part of what happened earlier today. Today’s incident does not involve the main stakeholders and we don’t recognise those who attempted to pull the chariot,” Maharjan said The exact details of who started the protests is not known yet.  However, according to Rai, nine people were leading the protests and among them were those who beat up a traffic policeman.  Among those arrested is activist Yaddab Lal Kayastha who can be seen arguing with the police without a mask on videos making the rounds on social media, a protester said. “Those leading the crowd could be jailed for up to six months as per the Infectious Disease Act 1964,” said Assistant CDO Lalit Basnet. But as the day unfolded, a meeting between stakeholders decided that the festival will commence from Friday. “No one present at the meeting took what happened today positively,” said spokesperson of the Guthi Sanstan Saroj Thapaliya.  A meeting in the evening between representatives of the various bodies involved in the festival, Chief District Officer Narayan Prasad Bhatta and Mayor of Lalitpur Metropolitan City Chiribabu Maharjan decided to resume the rituals with Chhama puja on Friday.  “The chariot is in no position to be moved and may topple over, “ Maharjan told the Post. “Therefore the idol will be carried to the four destinations and on September 7 taken to Bungmati.”  As a precautionary measure following clashes on Thursday, the Lalitpur district administration office has announced a curfew within the ring road from 4 am to 10 pm on Friday.  Spokesperson Thapaliya says that what happened was a result of the public losing patience with the government and the district authorities and added that the Guthi Sansthan was unaware about the protest until people started to pull the chariot. He said that the guthi is responsible for conducting the puja and other rituals related to the festival while the local authority’s role is to assist them with the pulling of the chariot, an issue that has been in limbo since it was built back in June. The festival organisers had decided to organise the festival after the government eased the lockdown in mid-June. “This was an outburst of spiritual and cultural beliefs,” said Thapaliya. “We cannot call it wrong entirely because this is something to do with people’s faith and belief. However, we do feel this could have been avoided.” A group had even written to the office of President Bidya Devi Bhandari asking her how to conduct the festival this year, but they say that they got no response. What also caused today's incident is the significance the festival holds for the people of Patan. The locals believe the chariot festival has to be completed before the onset of Malmas, which is considered an inauspicious time to conduct any festivals.There is also a belief that if the chariot isn’t pulled before the start of the malmas which starts in mid-September, the idol of Rato Machindranath has to be taken to Bhaktapur. According to John Locke in his book Karunamaya, if the chariot still houses the idol of Rato Machindranath beyond the eight day of the dark half of Ashwin, the people of Bhaktapur have the right to take the idol with them to Bhaktapur. Keeping such aspects in mind, Thapaliya also informed that in previously held meetings with authorities, they had talked about how to conduct and conclude the festival. Another protest also took place in Gabahal where locals tore down a police booth, used it as a shield and started pelting stones at police. Locals were agitated because the chariot wasn’t pulled to Gabahal, which is what is traditionally done on the first day of the procession.  “This could have been avoided had they let the locals pull it to Gabahal. The way the police acted was not correct,” said Rohan Bajracharya, another local of Patan. The four destinations of the chariot are Gahabahal, Sundhara, Lagankhel and Jawalakhel where the Bhoto Jatra is held.  Senior Superintendent Rai told the Post that four police personnel and dozens of others were injured in the clash  “We are investigating the case further and have arrested the concerned people. They seem to have gathered people through their facebook page called Hamro Jatra,” said Rai.  Even Patan locals were not happy about what happened today. Sunny Rajbhandari, a Patan resident, questioned who will be put to blame if today’s incident sparked an outbreak in Patan. “I can’t believe how stupid people can get at such a senstive time. We still don't know who initiated the chaos today which in itself, to be honest, is appalling,” said Rajbhandari. Besides the proper process was not followed in the pulling of the chariot.  “There was no one to hold the khadga, the guruju paltan weren’t present and most importantly there was no formal announcement” said Rajbhandari. “ I want to ask the people who haphazardly started the procession if they know what actually goes on during the festival. Or are they just trying to prove a point?”",Valley,https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2020/09/04/authorities-caught-unaware-of-protests-despite-calls-for-allowing-the-machhindranath-chariot-festival

45,Over two dozen Kathmandu city officials in self-isolation,"September 3, 2020","After Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s Mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya tested positive for Covid-19 positive on Monday, over two dozen key city officials, including half a dozen ward officers, in close contact with Shakya have isolated themselves at home. With the officials staying home, the response of the city, most affected by the pandemic in the Valley, has been affected as the remaining officials don’t have the authority to make decisions, even during emergencies.. After the mayor tested positive for Covid-19, Chief Executive Ek Naraya Aryal, Joint Secretary Rajeshwor Gyawali, administration chief Nwaraj Dhakal, the mayor’s personal secretary Rajeshowr Stapit, and Spokesperson Ishwor Man Dangol, among others others have been staying home.  “This is a great misfortune for the city. The number of Covid-19 cases is sharply increasing, but those who need to be out there making quick decisions are at home,” said a city official on the condition of anonymity. He further said the city is yet to allocate funds for relief and rescue measures. “Mayor Shakya is also the coordinator of the city’s Disaster Management Committee. There’s a dire need to distribute relief materials to people as many of the poor have nothing to eat and cases in most of the wards are increasing,” said the official.  Deputy Mayor Hari Prabha Khadgi, who has been coming to work, said Mayor Shakya has not delegated any responsibilities to her even as he isolates himself at home. “ I called him on Wednesday morning, and told him to hand over some responsibilities to me,” said Khadgi. “But he said he will carry out all of his work from home. He needs to stay in isolation for two weeks and people are dying already. How will he work from home?” questioned Khadgi, the only top official not in self- isolation.  According to the Public Health Division of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, 2,707 have tested positive for Covid-19 and 19 have died of ailments related to the infection, as of August 30.  “We are yet to get data for the last three days. But the situation is getting worse,” said Gyan Bahadur Oli, the Covid-19 focal person at the municipal health department. The city has tested 4,325 people so far.  “I myself am in self isolation as I was in close contact with Mayor Shakya,” Chief Executive Aryal told the Post on the phone. Asked about the fate of the 5,000-bed integrated isolation centers the mayor promised three weeks ago, Aryal said he didn't know about it. “All political decisions have to be made by the mayor. I am only authorised to carry out administrative work, and I am doing that from home,” Aryal added.  Last week, Shakya, who is also the coordinator of the Valley Mayors’ Forum—a grouping of mayors in the Valley, held a meeting with Minister for Health Bhaubhakta Dhakal, Health Secretary Laxam Aryal, Lalitpur Mayor Chiribabu Maharjan and Madhyapur Thimi Mayor Madan Sundar Shrestha to discuss the proposed integrated isolation centre. But after Mayor Shakya contracted the infection, the discussions have beens stalled, with participants of the meeting isolating themselves at home or getting tested. With sharp increments in Covid-19 cases in the city, virologists say that the disease has already spread at the community level.  “It seems that the disease is being transmitted from one family to another. The impacts of the two weeks of restrictions are yet to be seen, but the local and federal government should work with better plans to halt this rapid transmission,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, a virologist at Teku based Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital.  Chief Executive Aryal also said the integrated isolation centre had become a necessity for the city, but as its construction to be expedited by the political leadership of the city, he can’t do anything about it. “Because in our city, a single house is home to over 50 people living in different rooms, if one family gets infected, others also catch the disease. If only we could prepare an isolation centre, we could stop the rapid transmission,” said Aryal.

46,Prohibitory orders to continue for one more week in the Valley ,"September 2, 2020","Prohibitory orders in Kathmandu Valley have once again been extended by another week–until September 9 midnight. Chief district officers of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur on Wednesday decided to continue the restrictions, saying there has been no let up in the coronavirus infection cases.  “In view of the continuous increase in the coronavirus cases, we have decided to extend the ongoing prohibitory orders for one more week,” said Narayan Prasad Bhatta, chief district officer of Lalitpur. “We are trying to make the restrictions more effective.” Bhatta, however, said a standard for online home delivery is being prepared and home delivery will be allowed with strict implementation of the health protocol. This is the second extension of the prohibitory orders in the Valley after it was first imposed on August 19 midnight for a week. The second extension was due to expire on Wednesday midnight.  According to a notice, the chief district officers have also decided that anyone wishing to enter the Valley for emergency work must have the coronavirus RT PCR negative report.  The time frame for purchasing essential goods has also been extended till 11am from the previous 9am. The authorities have also allowed shops and vehicles related to development works from 2pm to 9pm.  National pride projects and industries related to essential services can also operate by setting up quarantine facilities.  The local administrations in the Valley have also instructed the ward committee offices to monitor whether the people whose swabs have been taken for the coronavirus test and those on the list of contact tracing are living in home isolation.

47,"With traffic police hit by corona, dummies make road users aware of proposed hike in fines","September 2, 2020","The Metropolitan Traffic Division Office has installed mannequins dressed as traffic police at various locations of the city to make road users aware of proposed hikes in fines after dozens of personnel tested positive for coronavirus. The placard-holding mannequins are part of the police’s campaign to convey to the public that fines are being hiked, officials said as the number of traffic police personnel to contract the disease in the Valley soared to 133.  “We put up the placards to send a clear message to the people that they will be charged Rs 500 to 10,000 if they violate the traffic rules,'' said Senior Superintendent Bhim Prasad Dhakal, chief at the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, which has put up 22 mannequins in various parts of the city holding placards that read “violating the traffic rules may attract a fine of up to Rs 10,000.”  The division office had last year—during the tenure of chief Basant Pant—announced a hike in traffic violation fines from Rs 500 to up to Rs 10,000. But after the criticism from the media and various sections of society, the division fixed the maximum fine at Rs 1,000.  The division has been booking bikers and motorists for drunk driving (MaPaSe) and fining them Rs 1,000 and making it compulsory for them to attend an hour-long class on traffic rules. It has been charging Rs 500 for those who violate lane discipline.  “We have placed the dummies with placards so that people are aware of the new rules,” said Dhakal. The office has installed mannequins dressed in police uniform in front of Singhadurbar, and in Maitighar, Naya Baneshwor, Baluwatar, Lainchaur, Bhotahiti, Bhadrakali, Thapathali, Kalimati, Kalanki, Jadibuti, Koteshwor, Gaushala, Purano Baneshwor, Krishna Pauroti, Nagdhunga and Jagati. Rameshwor Yadav, newly appointed spokesperson for the division, said the division office is planning to install a total of 50 dummies across the Valley. He said the dummies, each of which costs Rs 18,000, also serve another purpose.  “We have installed the dummies with money from Kathmandu Metropolitan City,” said Yadav. “The dummies look like a traffic police, and during the night, people who drive under the influence of alcohol will take them for traffic police,” said Yadav. He said those found violating lane discipline will soon be charged Rs 10,000. Yadav also said the department has already consulted the Department of Transportation to implement the new. “Till now, the law does not permit traffic police to charge more than Rs 2,ooo, but once the Department of Transport Management decides, violators can be charged up to Rs 10,000,” said Yadav.

48,Kathmandu’s Mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya tests positive for Covid-19,"August 31, 2020","In yet another proof of the unchecked spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in Kathmandu Valley, Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s Mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya has tested positive for coronavirus, according to a municipality source. Shakya, who had come under criticism from chairs of wards of his own city for not doing enough to check the spread of the virus, had been pointing fingers at the federal government for allowing people to enter the Valley without restrictions.  The mayor visited Grande International Hospital, Tokha, for a check-up on Sunday with his unwell wife. His wife has, however, tested negative.  Until the first week of August, Mayor Shakya was reluctant to establish a quarantine facility or isolation centre in the city. But with the rapid spread of the virus and growing pressure from the people, the mayor on August 10, announced he would build integrated isolation centers to accommodate 5,000 people.  But he has little progress to show even three weeks after the announcement. This means that hundreds of infected people are forced to isolate themselves in their homes as hospital beds are unavailable.  “I am surprised to hear that Mayor Shakya tested positive,” said Nil Kaji Shakya, chairperson of Ward No. 25, who had long been accusing Shakya of only consulting ward representatives close to him. “Now, Deputy Mayor Hari Bhabha Khadgi should run our board meetings, and she should work actively to prevent the further spread of the disease,” said Shakya.  According to a report by the public health department of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, a total of 2,452 positive cases have been recorded in the city as of August 29. On Monday, 190 positive cases were reported in Kathmandu district and 372 on Sunday, the Ministry of Health and Population said. The municipality-wise breakdown of figures for the district for the last two days is not available.  On Sunday, a record 415 persons from the Valley tested positive while the figure came down to 298 on Monday.  The Covid-19 death toll in the Valley stands at 35.  The total number of cases in the country stands at 39,460 with 899 new cases reported Monday. The total death toll is 228, according to the ministry .  Meanwhile, those who have had close contact with Mayor Shakya have said they are worried about their own status. Lalitpur Mayor Chiri Babu Maharjan told the Post on Monday evening that he decided to get himself tested on Tuesday after he heard about his Kathmandu counterpart’s positive result.  “After we had a meeting at the home ministry on Thursday, the mayor of Thimi and I had taken a photo with Mayor Shakya in the middle. Though we maintained distance, I am quite worried,” said Maharjan. “I have also been meeting and interacting with people at the grassroots.”  Madan Sundar Shrestha, mayor of the Madhyapur Thimi Municipality also plans to get tested on Tuesday.  According to Shrestha, mayors from Kathmandu Valley, Minister for Health Bhanubhakta Dhakal, Health Secretary Laxman Aryal, and Home Secretary Maheshowr Neupane were among those present at the meeting.

49,Kathmandu CDO to allow online home delivery after developing a standard and monitoring mechanism ,"August 30, 2020","After widespread criticism, the District Administration Office of Kathmandu has formed a study team to make recommendations on how online home delivery service can be resumed. According to the DAO officials, a study team led by Assistant Chief District Officer Janak Bhatta has been formed with representatives of the Health Ministry, Department of Commerce, Supply and Consumer Protection Management, and Nepal Police.  Police had rounded up a number of delivery people on Wednesday and Thursday last week after Chief District Officer of Kathmandu Janak Raj Dahal said they were not allowed to operate when the prohibition orders were in place. Following the curb on their operations the companies had urged him to allow their business as they were ready to follow all necessary health protocols.  But Dahal had refused saying that they do not have proper standards and monitoring mechanisms. With the discussions with stakeholders on Sunday the Kathmandu DAO has decided to form a study team to devise necessary standards and the monitoring mechanism.  Assistant Chief District Officer Bhatta said his team will present its report which will also include the standard to be implemented for online delivery within two to three days and then they will hold discussions with the stakeholders before implementing the standard. “Citing international practices and the complaints that there happened to be a crowd in the morning due to the time limit we have decided to study how the online delivery could be managed without affecting our concern to control the virus,” Bhatta told the Post. “If we could complete all our tasks within three days, it will be implemented right away. If not, it will be effective from the next extension of the prohibition order.” All three chief district officers have extended the prohibition orders, which was enforced on August 18 for one week, by another week till September 2 midnight.  After the Kathmandu DAO finalises the standards for online shopping and home delivery services, it will be implemented throughout the Kathmandu Valley, including Lalitpur and Bhaktapur as well.",Valley,https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2020/08/30/kathmandu-cdo-to-allow-online-home-delivery-after-developing-a-standard-and-monitoring-mechanism
50,Lalitpur starts sending home learning materials to students,"August 29, 2020","In a bid to keep students who have been staying home for over four months due to Covid-19 pandemic engaged in learning, Lalitpur Metropolitan City has started sending them “home learning materials”. The city started the campaign to keep primary-level students from community schools who don’t have access to the internet engaged in learning, said Mayor Chiri Babu Maharjan. Officials said the city received around Rs 150,000 from the Education Ministry to print the learning materials.  “At this time we are mainly focusing on students under grade three who attend community schools in the city,” said Maharjan.  The materials, designed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, tech students to draw and learn alphabets, among others. Of the 40 community schools in the city, 25 run classes up to grade 12, ten till class eight and five till the fifth grade.  “This is a great means of learning for children who are confined to their homes due to pandemic,” said Kadam Baba Pradhan, principal at Tri Padma Vidyashram Secondary School, Pulchowk. “Our school received all the printed materials from the city, but we haven’t been able to send it to the students’ households because of the restrictions. As soon as these restrictions are relaxed, we will send them to the students,” said Pradhan.  Schools and colleges all across the country have been closed since March 18. The government is yet to come up with a roadmap to reopen schools.  Most people from lower economic backgrounds enroll their children in community schools. Majority of them do not have access to the internet or laptops to attend online classes. This trend is not only limited to Lalitpur, children from working class families across the country are being deprived of learning although virtual classes have roped in children from middle and upper class families.  Nava Raj Rijal, the city’s education officer, said the city has sent the learning materials to all schools. “Students above class five can learn from the internet, and there have been online classes going on via different FM radios and televisions, but primary level kids can’t comprehend those things,” said Rijal. Education experts have welcomed the move but have raised questions about its effectiveness. “Just sending materials to students does not work, the school concerned should have a mechanism to monitor if children are learning or not,” said Binay Kusiyat, a professor at the Tribhuvan University.  Rijal from the education office said with the learning materials, even partially literate parents can guide their children. The 176-page material has tasks for students for 45 days, which they can perform with the help of their parents. And at the end of each task, parents can test their own kids’ knowledge.

51,Unplanned growth of urban sprawl puts lives and houses at risk in Valley,"August 29, 2020","It’s hard for 54-year-old Sher Bahadur Shrestha to come to terms with the loss of his home. The house he built atop a small hillside six years ago in Dhapakhel, of Lalitpur Metropolitan City tumbled down when the land where his house stood slid down following heavy rains last month.  “It was a beautiful place, and we never had any problem with monsoon before. I never imagined something like this would ever happen to me,”said Shrestha. Aware that his house may be damaged, no one was inside that afternoon.  Nearly a dozen other houses near his are at risk and several of them have been severely damaged with cracks.  According to the Dinesh Karki, ward chair of Lalitpur-24, several places in the area suffered from flash floods and about 31 places in the area were pulled down by landslides after incessant rain in the third week of July.   “Who would have thought this could happen inside the Valley itself,” said Shrestha.  But according to urban planning and land development experts, the event is not the first of its kind. Instead, it is another incident revealing the haphazard use of land for urban settlement that doesn’t reckon risk-sensitive planning of land.  After houses were brought down to rubble during the earthquake of 2015, experts pointed out that authorities had faltered in regulating and overseeing land use by the people. An example of it can be the Gongabu neighbourhood, where many tall buildings were damaged in the earthquake costing the lives of many.  A study by National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED), a research institute based in Japan, highlights that one of the reasons the place was affected the most in the earthquake was because the structures were built atop soft ground inappropriate for load-bearing. But over the years, the unregulated use of excavators and human activities for building and road constructions without considering its impact on the environment have also made Kathmandu’s land fragile, says Suman Maher Shrestha, a senior urban planner.  “Kathmandu’s urban settlement has violated terms of land use. Houses and private commercial structures have cropped up even in places where land cannot withhold loads,” said Shrestha. “There are houses near floodplain areas, and houses even where only farming can be done.” The Valley since the early 1990s has undergone rapid changes, and according to a study conducted by GSDRC Helpdesk Research, a US-based research institute, the Kathmandu Valley is one of the fastest-growing urban agglomerations in South Asia that has seen an increase in new homes and buildings.  However, many of these settlements and buildings use land inappropriately without any risk management. And so every year in monsoon Kathmandu Valley suffers from several floods and landslides. The unchecked and reckless land use in the Valley has increased the severity of the monsoon disasters. On the same day Shrestha lost his house in Dhapakhel, another landslide was reported at a construction site for a commercial complexat at Tashi Danda in Tokha Municipality, Kathmandu. Two minors were killed when the inclined slope subsided burying a temporary workshop.  “The landslide probably would not have occurred if they had not plotted the land in the area. The heavy rain pushed down the area because they meddled with the soil and unfortunately two lives were lost,” said Gyan Maya Dangol, deputy chief at Tokha Municipality.  Experts believe the Valley’s land use should be monitored even more seriously now since the 2015 earthquake has weakened the tenacity of the Valley’s earth. “The local government needs to take more responsibility to understand and oversee the soil penetration of residential settlements or any type of land use in their area,” said Shrestha, the urban planner.  The Dhapakhel area was sprawling farmland before urban settlement started in early 2000. It is a relatively new urban settlement that has grown rapidly over the years.  “It is in these fringes that new settlers are moving into these days,” said Shrestha.  Shankar Deula, whose house is now hanging very delicately on the Dhapakhel cliff , remembers greenery as one of the highlights of Dhapakhel when he first settled there a decade ago. “There were a lot of trees at the time,” he says.  Deula’s family of five has also been prohibited from entering their house by the police as it is in the risk of toppling down, like Sher Bahadur Shrestha’s house.  A rapid study, conducted by a team facilitated by Soil Conservation and Watershed Management Office and Kathmandu Valley Development Authority through Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority after the landslide, reported the land’s vulnerability might have increased with the heavy rainfall and the increased water level in the vicinity’s rivers that cut through the base of the land. Surface water erosion because of improper surface water management and soil quality were mentioned as other reasons for the landslides in the area.  “We also found out that disturbance of human activities such as road construction could have added to the vulnerability besides the settlement being in a slope,” said Bishal KC, an engineer who was part of the study. “And it’s not that we cannot have settlements on sloped land but the management of the land in such areas need to adhere to some specific soil bioengineering mechanisms and in this case, we didn’t see such safety systems.”  According to Bishnu Bhandari, senior watershed management expert, there are particularly two reasons for Kathmandu's landslides, the changing climate that has affected rainfall and the eroding land.  “In recent years, our rainfall pattern has changed, it rains incessantly in a short duration of time and in many areas its force causes landslides. But you also have to understand that Kathmandu’s soil is fragile as it has unstable landscape and so we need to assess the type of land before building structures to prevent disasters,” said Bhandari.  In its report, Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has also suggested building embankments and gabion retaining walls, a retaining wall made with stones that is tied together with wire to support the slope of the hill. It also suggests constructing check dams to lower the speed of concentrated water flows and implementing bio-engineering measures to rebuild the area.  However, these solutions should have been part of a pre-urban settlement planning, said Shrestha, the urban planner. “Had these solutions been a part of the development of the area the recent disaster could have been averted,” he said.  But one of the terminal challenges of the growing urban settlement is the people’s disinterest in understanding the use of land. Many urbanites building houses and buildings are not aware of seismic safety and have very little idea about how improper drainage systems and soil quality can affect a building.  “Unless people are aware and the government takes the necessary steps to implement these requirements, we will continue to put people’s lives at risk,” said Shrestha.  Meanwhile for Sher Bahadur Shrestha and Shankar Deula, the recent event in Dhapakhel has only made their circumstances even more vulnerable amid the coronavirus pandemic. With no solutions forthcoming, they are just trying to endure their reality.

52,Mayor Shakya under fire for his lack of initiative to contain coronavirus spread,"August 29, 2020","On August 10, Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s Mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya, who also chairs the Valley’s mayor forum, announced plans to build integrated isolation centers to accommodate 5,0000 people. Two weeks after the announcement, none of the ward representatives in the city know where the integrated isolation center is going to be established. Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in Kathmandu Valley is increasing rapidly. The Valley on Friday recorded the daily highest number of coronavirus cases at 415, of which 350 were detected in Kathmandu alone.  Unable to cope with the situation, ward officials in Kathmandu have directed their frustration towards Shakya. They have accused the mayor of holding high level meetings and doing nothing substantial on the ground to avert the coming crisis.  “The city is fast turning into a coronavirus hotspot, but mayor Shakya has not even met us to inquire about the situation of the ward,” said Nilkaji Shakya, ward chairperson of Kathmandu-25. “The mayor is having meetings with other mayors of the Valley but he is ignoring the ward representatives.” Setting up isolation centres in Kathmandu is crucial to managing and treating Covid-19 patients, as all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients are full. Ward representatives of Kathmandu say keeping infected people in home isolation is not safe, as many people live in small rooms and apartments with shared bathrooms. Health officials say the higher level officials should consult with ward level officials to minimise the coronavirus spread.  “Not consulting with local level officials is the main problem. We only see ministers, secretary level officials in the Covid-19 meetings who know nothing about the ground reality,” Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, virologist, also chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “During this suition, ward representatives are the ones who have closely seen the suition in their areas.”  Sobha Sapkota, a ward representative of Kathmandu-14, said her ward is one of the most affected areas with more than 100 coronavirus cases, but the mayor’s office has so far made no effort whatsoever to contain the virus spread. “Each ward has its own set of problems concerning the coronavirus spread and management and treatment of the infected people. But our leadership is busy holding meetings after meetings with no work to show at the ground level,” said Sapkota.  She said at least 300 people need to be tested in her ward, but only 100 have been tested till date.

53,Kathmandu announces plan to monitor market as people find vegetables too costly,"August 27, 2020","Sumana Karki from Soltimode in Kathmandu has constant worry of late—how to manage food for her six-member family. In the past few weeks, prices of green vegetables have soared in Kathmandu Valley. Consumers are forced to pay through the nose to buy vegetables. Some can’t afford fresh vegetables due to the rocketing prices. Karki said she has not purchased tomatoes, after a kilo of it was priced Rs 100. “Even cabbage costs Rs 70 per kg, and you don’t get anything for less than Rs 100 per kg,” said Karki. Prices are soaring at a time when people have lost their incomes due to the pandemic as authorities have enforced a shutdown. Unscrupulous traders are hiking the prices of vegetables, fruits and essential food items when the city is in the grip of Covid-19. Consumers say the authorities are doing nothing to rein in the prices. After much public criticism, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has announced its plan to monitor the market but consumer rights groups don’t readily believe the authorities will be able to bring down the prices. A meeting on Tuesday chaired by the municipal market inspection committee chief Hari Prabha Khadgi, the deputy mayor, announced that a strict monitoring mechanism would be reactivated across the city from this week. “We are working with all stakeholders to carry out an inspection,” Khadgi told the meeting also attended by the officials from the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, Nepal Chamber of Commerce and consumer rights activists. Consumer rights groups have welcomed the move, but have doubts about its effective implementation. “The constitution of Nepal empowers all local units to draft their own Local market Management Act but the Kathmandu city lacks it,” said consumer right activist Jyoti Baniya, who chairs the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights-Nepal. According to Baniya, eleven municipalities including Kaliya Sub-metropolitan city, Damak Municipality, Bhimeshwor Municipality, Waling Municipality, Tansen Municipality, Birendranagar Municipality, Tikapur Municipality and Itahari Municipality have their own local market monitoring Acts. Although the Cabinet approved the ‘Orders to ensure quality and standard of foods’ in the first week of August, it has not been used to maintain the quality of food items.  Binaya Shrestha, deputy director of the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, said the price of vegetables is high since it's the off-season and the import of green vegetables from India is restricted due to the fear of Covid-19 transmission.  “But we don’t think there is an inadequate supply of vegetables in the Valley,” said Shrestha. “There might be some middlemen taking advantage of this difficult situation.” He suggested that customers look at the board’s website before going out to buy vegetables from nearby shops.  Shrestha expressed the board’s readiness to assist the city in market inspection if they are invited to help.  When the Post contacted a few wholesalers in Kalimati and Balkhu markets, they said wholesale prices are not high compared to what retail shops are charging.  “The cost of tomato has not crossed Rs 60 per kilogram and bitter gourd is available for Rs 45 per kg but we have heard retailers are selling them for over Rs 100 per kg,” said Arjun Dhungana, a vegetable wholesaler in Balkhu, Kathmandu. “The government has set a time limit for buying goods. Local traders are taking advantage as customers don’t have much choice,” said Dhungana, who supplied vegetables free of charge to needy people during the four-month long nationwide lockdown.",Valley,https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2020/08/27/kathmandu-announces-plan-to-monitor-market-as-people-find-vegetables-too-costly
54,Covid-19 restrictions in Valley to continue until September 2,"August 26, 2020","District Administration Offices of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur have decided to extend the ongoing prohibitory orders by a week until September 2. The Valley districts have been under prohibitory orders, barring public mobility and vehicular movements, since August 19 midnight as an attempt to contain the spread of the virus. The orders last week were announced for a week until midnight of August 26. An official confirmed that prohibitory orders have been extended by a week. “We have decided to extend the prohibitory orders as there still is a threat of the virus spread,” said the official.  The government last week granted authority to chief district officers to impose prohibitory orders or even a curfew in their respective districts to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the wake of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country. Kathmandu Valley was put under prohibitory orders after there was a sudden surge in the number of Covid-19 cases. As of Tuesday, the Valley has reported 3,718 coronavirus cases–2,955 in Kathmandu, 462 in Lalitpur and 301 in Bhaktapur.  As many as 232 new cases were reported from the Valley on Tuesday, with 199 from Kathmandu, 19 from Lalitpur and 14 from Bhaktapur.

The forum’s meeting on Monday decided to run tests on 28,500 people identified through contact tracing of infected individuals in all 17 local units of the Valley, according to Madan Sundar Shrestha, secretary of the forum. “We plan to start the tests from Wednesday and complete the process within one week,” said Shrestha, also the mayor of Madhyapur Thimi Municipality  Shrestha said the testing expenses will be borne by the concerned local bodies.  Meanwhile, works to build integrated isolation centres to accommodate 5,000 people have not been started even though the Covid-19 cases are rapidly rising. Till Tuesday, the Valley has recorded  3,718 Covid-19 cases— 2,955 in Kathmandu, 463 in Lalitpur and 301 in Bhaktapur. Twenty people have died so far. The representatives of the forum the Post spoke with said preparations were underway to set up integrated isolation centers under the task force of Maheshowr Neupane, secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs.  In Monday’s meeting, the forum also released the data of infected persons in all local units of the Valley.  According to forum’s data, the Valley had reported 2,746 cases of Covid-19 as of August 22 (Saturday) — 1,606 cases in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, 185 in Lalitpur Metropolitan City, 125 in Budhanilkantha Municipality, 109 in Tokha Municipality, 105 in Madhyapur Thimi Municipality, 96 in Kageshwori Municipality, 84 in Mahalaxmi Municipality, 73 in Suryabinayak Municipality and 62 in Chandragiri Municipality.

56,Fear of stigmatisation has hindered contact tracing in Kathmandu,"August 24, 2020","Uma Basnet, a health officer at Kathmandu Metropolitan City Ward-15, made numerous attempts to reach Imran (name changed), 23, on his mobile phone to inform him that he had tested positive for coronavirus infection.  Imran had given his swab samples for a test a week ago. After his result came positive, Basnet had been trying to get hold of Imran since Friday, but without avail.  When Imran finally answered the phone on Sunday, he at first tried to misidentify himself as Salman Ali. It was only after Basnet warned to report him to the police did Imran agree to cooperate.  “He said that he had reached Sarlahi last week and that he was observing isolation,” Basnet said.  The Post could not ascertain whether Imran was telling the truth about his whereabouts and whether he was isolating from others after contracting the coronavirus infection.  For Basnet people giving false personal details, not picking up their phones and claiming that she had reached a wrong number when they do answer their phones are nothing new in her contact tracing work.  She says people just do not want to associate themselves with the coronavirus.  “They feel stigmatised and try to hide their condition,” Basnet told the Post, recalling another incident where a 45-year-old woman from Dallu beseeched for absolute anonymity after learning that she had contracted the virus.  “She pleaded with me to keep her condition a secret from her neighbours and office colleagues,” said Basnet.  The woman is said to be observing self-isolation at her home. She has also requested the ward office to conduct tests on her two sons.  People giving fake personal details and lying to the contact tracing officers have hindered the Covid-19 containment measures in Kathmandu, officials say. According to Gyan Bahadur Oli, the Covid-19 focal person at the public health division of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, contact tracing officers come across at least a dozen cases of deliberate misidentification daily.  “This is going on in all 32 wards of Kathmandu and we get regular complaints from health workers about the problem they are facing in the contact tracing work,” Oli told the Post.  While the identity of the infected persons are not revealed to the public, there seems to be a widespread fear among them of their names being disclosed. Officials say this tendency is mainly due to the incidents of mistreatment and abuse faced by Covid-19 patients as well as health workers in communities. “Infected people are forced to hide their condition out of fear of being ostracised and abused. This is a serious issue,” said Mukunda Rijal, the ward chairman of Kathmandu-16. “In Ward-16 alone, more than 12 percent of the people who got tested for Covid-19 had given false personal details. How can we locate the infected person and their close contacts if we do not have their details?”  Anthropologists say insecurity and social fear concerning Covid-19 should be dispelled through awareness campaigns. “Infected persons fear what others might say or do. The government and other stakeholders must inform and educate the people about this disease, or else the social stigmatisation of Covid-19 patients is not going to end,” Suresh Dhakal, an anthropologist, told the Post.  Shaligram Bhattarai, a clinical psychologist and the coordinator at Centre for Mental Health and Counselling Nepal, also agrees that the onus lies on the government when it comes to informing the public about the coronavirus, how it spreads and what to do if a person thinks he or she is infected.",Valley,https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2020/08/24/fear-of-stigmatisation-has-hindered-contact-tracing-in-kathmandu
57,"Mayor Shakya plans to build isolation centres, but no one knows when","August 23, 2020","Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s Mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya, who also leads the Valley’s mayor forum, announced plans to build integrated isolation centres to accommodate 5,000 people, on August 10. Nearly two weeks after his announcement, as the number of Covid-19 cases steadily rises in the city, no one knows where the isolation centres will be built and when, though there has been a lot of chatter about it in the news and on social media.  Shakya, even on Tuesday, the day before the three chief district officers of the valley announced restrictions on public mobility,  reiterated his plans to build the 5,000-bed-isolation wards by working with the central, federal and the local governments inside the Valley within a week. According to the municipal public health division of the city, as of Thursday 1,411 people have been infected with Covid-19 in the metropolis. “The mayor announced that the isolation centres will be established nearly two weeks ago, but the plans haven’t materialised yet,” said Shakya’s deputy Hari Prabha Khadgi adding that she doesn’t know the details of the mayor’s plan. “We need the centres now urgently as Covid-19 cases are increasing by the day in our city,” she added.  Mayor Shakya has always been reluctant to establish even quarantine centres in the city. He has been blaming the provincial government for letting people from outside enter into the Valley without restrictions.  However, looking at the present growth in Covid-19 cases in the valley, experts say it’s become necessary to establish the isolation centres soon. Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, a virologist at the Teku-based Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, said that in the absence of isolation centres, the disease will get more pervasive in the community, even when restrictions on mobility are enforced.  The hospital’s data shows that since the local authorities announced the prohibitory order on Thursday, the number of people visiting the hospital with Covid-19 has steadily come down. Before the restrictions came into effect, 300 of the 1,000 people who would visit the hospital would get tested. But after the restrictions, the hospital has been testing only 100 people per day. “Due to lack of transportation facilities and strict monitoring, very few people are coming to the hospital,” said Pun. He said that prohibitory orders don’t work, unless the contract tracing and testing is done swiftly.  “There is a danger of transmission of the disease within the family as many families share a building in Kathmandu,” said Pun. That’s why separate centres are needed to isolate the infected, he added. When the Post contacted the city office’s chief executive Ek Narayan Aryal to ask about the integrated isolation centre the mayor has been talking about, he said city officials have been consulting with the federal government and the Cabinet has already approved the plan.  “According to our estimate, around 500 people, including traffic police and Nepal Police personnel, are in home isolation in the city,” Aryal said. He said setting up integrated isolation centres was now possible as the government hiked the money allocated for each isolation bed from Rs 175 to Rs 1,800. “With this amount, we can run the isolation centre at a given standard,” he said.",Valley,https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2020/08/23/mayor-shakya-plans-to-build-isolation-centers-but-no-one-knows-when
58,Government decision to keep asymptomatic patients in home isolation raises fear among city residents,"August 23, 2020","Ojir, 37, is one of the 42 Covid-infected persons in Kathmandu Metropolitan Ward No. 32 currently in home isolation.He and his family had tested positive for Covid-19 on August 13. But isolating at home is not easy for Ojir, who lives in a rented flat in Koteshwor with his family of six.  “Due to a lack of quarantine centres and hospital beds, we have to stay isolated at home as instructed by local authorities. It’s scary because we are not getting any treatment nor are we getting food and essentials from local authorities or the government,” said Ojir, who wished to identify himself only by his first name.  According to Ojir, he and his family went to Teku Hospital to get tested for Covid-19 after another person in the same house was found to be infected.  “My family and I haven’t shown any symptoms so far, but we are really scared, as no one has come to check on our health conditions,” Ojir said. “The last call that I got from a health worker from Kathmandu Metropolitan City was nearly a week ago and there has been no followup since then.” Ward No. 32 is one of the hardest hit wards in Kathmandu Metropolitan City by Covid-19, with a total of 96 people infected so far. Out of the 92 infected, 42 are getting treatment in various hospitals, 47 are kept in home isolation and the remaining six have already been discharged from hospitals, according to ward member Hira Devi Pokharel. On Thursday, a Cabinet meeting had decided to hospitalise only symptomatic patients while asymptomatic patients would be asked to isolate at home. Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada, also the government spokesperson, made the decision public during a press meet in Kathmandu on Friday evening. The decision of the government to not hospitalise asymptomatic Covid-19 patients has created fear among many people living across the Valley, especially among those who live in cramped spaces. They are worried that if they test positive for Covid-19, they would have to stay in home isolation, exposing their family to the virus. “A man from another flat of the house we live in got infected but he was told to isolate at home. It was only after he started showing symptoms that he was admitted to a hospital,” said Ojir. “If the person was taken to a hospital immediately after testing positive, my family and I wouldn’t have gotten infected.”  The government decision came after a surge in the number of active Covid-19 cases across the country, resulting in a shortage of isolation beds in hospitals. The country has so far reported 31,117 Covid-19 cases—2,453 in Kathmandu alone, making it the district most affected by coronavirus in the country.  According to Maiya Saiju, a health worker at Kathmandu Metropolis, the city has assigned 10 dedicated teams of 4-5 members for contact tracing and keeping records of infected persons in home isolation. “When a person tests positive in Kathmandu, we get details about the patient from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Saiju. “Then we contact them and ask about their symptoms.” According to Saiju, if an infected person and their family do not show any symptoms, the health team does not test all of them. They are simply asked to isolate at home by health workers, who check on their health condition from time to time through a phone call, she said. Due to a lack of isolation beds in Kathmandu Metropolis, managing infected people has become one of the major challenges in the fight against Covid-19, said Saiju.  “We have stopped contact tracing, as Kathmandu lacks isolation and quarantine facilities. We don't have any option rather than telling infected people to stay in home isolation,” said Saiju. “We have been requesting the government to address the problem.” However, Dr. Jageshwor Gautam, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health and Population, claimed that they are only keeping those people in home isolation who have seperate rooms and toilets.  “Those who do not have such facilities are kept in an isolation centre,” Gautam told the post. According to Ishwar Man Dangol, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, there are currently no isolation centres in the city. “However, the government is planning to construct a 6,000-bed isolation centre in Kathmandu to keep the infected people who do not have the means to safely isolate at home,” said Dangol. Meanwhile, Ojir from Koteshwor says he and his family have been staying in and drinking turmeric hot water in hopes of recovering from the virus.

59,Confusion and chaos as Valley residents wake up to new Covid-19 restrictions,"August 21, 2020","Kumar Timilsena had opened his store at Kupondole for just half an hour on Thursday morning when policemen came on motorcycles, sirens blaring, and told him to close his shop. “I had just received a supply of milk from a dairy,” said the 40-year-old who operates a grocery store. “I guess the milk will go to waste now.” Later he learned from another shop that police had been going around, announcing that stores would be allowed to open from 4am to 7am only.  On Tuesday evening, chief district officers of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur issued prohibitory orders effective Wednesday midnight to contain the spread of the virus.  The orders say people should not come out of home unless for buying medicines and essentials, vehicles should remain off the roads and only those, including shops, providing essential services should operate. When Nalini Shah, who lives in Bakhundole, went out to buy some foodstuff about 8am on Thursday, she did not find any shops open. “I had gone to buy milk, but all shops were closed,” said Shah. “Nor could I buy vegetables.” Local administrations’ prohibitory orders seem to be stricter compared to the lockdown days, but they have failed to properly inform the public. “We had tentatively announced to allow shops selling daily essentials to open from 4am to 7am,” said Narayan Prasad Bhatta, chief district officer of Lalitpur. When there was a nationwide lockdown from March 24, essential shops selling foodstuff had been allowed to open initially until 9am, which later had been extended until 10am and then the whole day. The Tuesday decision of the chief district officers of the Valley, however, has created confusion among the people. Without clarity on the timings for buying essential stuff, many in different parts of the city thronged various shops, disregarding safety protocols and physical distancing. Police even held some who were out for morning walks and jogging. They, however, were let go later on after spending some time in “holding centres” the police have set up at various places. Police also stopped some who were on their way to office, as it was difficult for them to identify who was on essential services and who was not. On Thursday, banks said that their staff coming to work were stopped by police and their motorcycles were impounded. They warned that they will not provide services on Friday if the movement of their staff is not facilitated. Nepal Rastra Bank spokesman Gunakar Bhatta told the Post that the matter of obstruction of movement of the bank staff had been sorted out with the Home Ministry, as banks fall under the essential service category. Later on Thursday, the Kathmandu District Administration Office issued a notice, saying that movement of vehicles carrying essential workers would be facilitated. The Oli government’s decision to let chief district officers grant powers to issue prohibitory orders has already faced criticism with experts saying the move is against the spirit of the constitution, as it undermines provincial and local governments. The government’s move of allowing local administrators to take their own measures to contain the spread of the virus comes amid widespread criticism that it largely failed in the fight against the pandemic.  The prohibitory orders in the Valley were issued after a sudden surge in the number of Covid-19 cases over the past weeks after the government lifted the nationwide lockdown on July 21. The Health Ministry said 200 new cases were reported in Kathmandu Valley on Thursday–174 in Kathmandu, 18 in Lalitpur and eight in Bhaktapur. The total number of cases in Kathmandu Valley currently stands at 2,698—2151 in Kathmandu, 367 in Lalitpur, and 180 in Bhaktapur.  Local governments say they are helpless and that they are just facilitating the chief district officer’s orders. “Our role is to disseminate the message of the district administration office, and we are implementing its decision,” said Raju Man Manandhar, spokesperson for Lalitpur Metropolitan City.  Lalitpur Chief District Officer Bhatta admitted that there were complaints from the public about confusion in timings—as to when the shops will open and till when they can buy foodstuff. “We are having consultations over the issue,” Bhatta told the Post. “We may extend the period for buying and selling essential goods.” He, however, was quick to add that it’s incumbent upon the local federal units to decide when it comes to managing shops.  In Kathmandu, too, shopkeepers said they were confused about the district administrators’ orders. “Yesterday, police came and said there would be prohibitory orders from Thursday. But we were forced to close our shops after opening it for 15 minutes at 7am,” said Kiran Khanal, who owns a cold store in Dhobichaur. “We could not open the shops throughout the day.” Rajeshwor Gyawali, administrative spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, said he is unaware of the District Administration Office’s decision regarding the timings for shops selling foodstuff. Senior Superintendent Shyam Lal Gyawali, chief of the Kathmandu Metropolitan Police Range, said police were closing the shops as per the instructions from the local level.",Valley,https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2020/08/21/confusion-and-chaos-as-valley-residents-wake-up-to-new-covid-19-restrictions
60,Feeding plants to feed people,"September 6, 2020","The use of fertiliser is as old as farming. Scientists at Oxford University have proven the use of manure by agriculturists in Europe around 8,000 years ago. They found a significantly high level of nitrogen-15 isotope in 7,900-year-old cereals, lentils and peas retrieved from Europe, which is evidence of the use of manure in farming at that time. The use of chemical fertiliser started in the mid-20th century. Modern agriculture waited till the ground-breaking research of Justus von Liebig in the 19th century. He postulated that nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are the fundamental nutrients for plants. He reported that plants remove these elements from the soil. So, to maintain soil fertility, we need to replenish them. Nepal started to import chemical fertiliser in the early 1950s. The government established Agriculture Inputs Company in 1966 under the Ministry of Agriculture to import and distribute chemical fertiliser in Nepal. The government introduced subsidies in 1973-74 after seeing that marginal farmers would not be able to afford fertiliser which had become dearer following a hike in global oil prices. Since then, the government has been allocating a significant budget to purchase and distribute subsidised fertilisers. Nonetheless, news stories of farmers not getting fertiliser on time and annual shortages keep appearing in the media. Opposite results In the fiscal year 1997-98, following constant pressure from international agencies, the government withdrew fertiliser subsidies and ended the monopoly of Agriculture Inputs Company on the importation and distribution of fertiliser under the banner of liberalisation. But the move produced results that were just the opposite of what had been anticipated. Fertiliser imports and consumption plunged to record lows. Ultimately, in 2008-09, the government reintroduced fertiliser subsidies and took control over fertiliser imports too.  Under the new fertiliser policy, the government assigned Agriculture Inputs Company and Salt Trading Corporation to import and distribute subsidised fertiliser. Initially, cooperatives were the sole retailers of subsidised chemical fertiliser. A recently introduced directive took away the monopoly of cooperatives on retailing fertiliser. According to the World Bank's database, the global use of chemical fertiliser was recorded at 140.5 kg per hectare in 2016. Nepal was placed in the 131st place in fertiliser use at 74 kg per hectare. Our two neighbours India and China use 165.8 and 503.3 kg per hectare respectively.  Under the banner of modernisation and commercialisation, mono-cropping is still being promoted extensively instead of our traditional integrated farming system. The recent advocacy of monoculture is prompted by expectations of higher yield, trouble-free management, potentiality of greater mechanisation and consequently greater profitability. However, we were not able to provide all factors of production on time and at a cheap rate—specifically improved seeds and fertilisers. Furthermore, in comparison with our traditional integrated farming, mono-culture is not a sustainable alternative. We artificially created high demand for chemical fertiliser by abandoning our traditional fertilisation methods—green manuring, intercropping and farmyard manure—but failed to supply substitutes. We failed to acknowledge soil as an ecosystem. We saw soil as a mechanical source of nutrients, and firmly believed that we could provide those nutrients from synthetic sources. However, continuous application of imbalanced chemicals destroys the soil's native ecosystem. More importantly, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are not the only plant nutrients—16 micronutrients have been identified. The most important thing needed for plants to grow is organic matter. None of the chemical fertilisers provides organic matter. The government's 20-year vision document—Agriculture Development Strategy—aims to bring organic matter to 4 percent. But the government has been giving excessive focus to supplying as much urea, DAP and potash as farmers want.  Balanced diet Like the necessity for a balanced diet for humans, plants also need balanced nutrients. However, under the banner of chemical fertiliser, undue emphasis is being placed on nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Interestingly, there is also massive demand from farmers for urea, which has the highest nitrogen content of 46 percent. My coach at a training programme Prof Kevin D Walker once remarked how we disregard the items on our shopping list when we go to a supermarket, and instead buy things that are on offer. In the same way, farmers are asking for urea because the government is offering a huge subsidy on it. Therefore, a rethink of the subsidy proportion is urgent. India has redesigned its subsidies based on nutrients. The government's subsidy policy should promote balanced nutrient use.

61,The Galwan Valley stand-off,"September 6, 2020","India and China have a history of border conflict. The last Sino-Indian clash before 2020 was in 2017 in the Doklam region. It was a three-month-long stand-off between the two armies from June to August. The most recent military confrontation between the two countries was witnessed in the Galwan Valley in June 2020. The Galwan valley face-off was, however, not the end of the conflict. China reportedly moved in 20 martial art trainers from the Enbo Fight Club to the Tibetan plateau to train its forces, three weeks after the clash. The martial art fighters have been employed to help with border patrol and special forces. However, there is some ambiguity as to which border area have they been deployed to; some suggest that the fighters were reinforced near the Indian border. Experts have raised concerns over whether there is an ultimate agenda that China aspires to achieve or if the face-off was linked with its behaviour elsewhere. Some analysts have suspected that this stand-off is connected with the Kashmir angle; Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move to withdraw Kashmir’s special autonomy. Foreign affairs experts and China watchers believe that the conflict in the Galwan Valley was anticipated and calculated if viewed in light of China’s overall international performance. International incidents A few other international incidents which provoked anti-China sentiments worldwide include the incidents in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, resumption of Taiwan's observer status at the World Health Organisation, and the extension of China's National Security Law to Hong Kong in violation of its commitment to respect its autonomy for 50 years under the 'one country, two systems' pledge made in 1997. Moreover, China's global standing took a severe hit with the outbreak of Covid-19 and a widespread perception that it failed to curb the virus from spreading. Several countries, including the United States and Germany, have been vocal in expressing their criticism. In response, China supposedly undertook a well-publicised and choreographed ‘mask diplomacy’ overdrive to all its Belt and Road Initiative beneficiaries; medical aid was dispatched in small consignments several times. Subsequently, the beneficiary countries put flattering 'Thank you, President Xi' messages on their social media handles and acknowledged China’s successful management of the crisis. The ‘mask diplomacy’ overdrive did create a sense of positivity early on. However, as the virus spread worldwide, claiming several lives, the international community has been compelled to question China’s role. Chung-Kwang Tien, the representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre in India, says India’s ‘friendly geopolitical concessions’ toward China have borne no reciprocity. Just two weeks before the Doklam stand-off, Modi had proudly said, ‘It is true we have a border dispute with China. But in the last 40 years, not a single bullet has been fired because of it’. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson had 'welcomed Indian's positive remarks'. Following the stand-off which sparked anti-China and hyper-nationalist sentiments in India, the Indians decided to boycott Chinese goods, apps and burned the flag as well. Chinese media reported this as a ‘trade war’ and said that India’s economy was heavily dependent on China. By boycotting Chinese goods, India is ‘denying the poor their right to a better life’ and many Indian sectors will be ‘crippled’. 'Wolf Warrior diplomacy' refers to a top-rated thriller movie Wolf Warrior 2, in which Chinese commandos rescue Chinese citizens who find themselves caught in a violent war in an unnamed African country. The message the movie spread is this: No one messes with China. Chinese diplomats have recently been witnessed using unconventional approaches. Today, they are not only mainstream with Twitter and Instagram handles, but also convey their messages directly to the individual, where the action is intended or pending. Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi’s activism is a pure representative of all these. Popularly referred to as 'China’s Charm Offensive', Yanqi regularly features in the national dailies having a one-to-one meeting with the top echelons of Nepal. The Galwan Valley gets its name from the Galwan River which originates in the Aksai Chin region and joins the Shyok River. It is located in eastern Ladakh and is a vital road link to Daulat Beg Oldie, the world’s highest landing ground next to the Line of Actual Control. The Galwan Valley is considered strategic for both countries. The river is the highest ridgeline which allows China to control the Shyok route passes, which are close to the river. The country wants to control the area as it fears that India could end up threatening its position in Aksai Chin by using the Galwan River valley to its advantage. Furthermore, China is very opposed to India's constructing any tent or infrastructure in the area.  Diplomatic dialogue On July 10, India and China held yet another round of talks at the diplomatic level as per the agreement by both sides. The nations reviewed the progress made in the ongoing disengagement process and agreed on 'overall development' of bilateral ties. The talks were held under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs between Naveen Srivastava, joint secretary (East Asia), and Wu Jianghao, director-general of the Department of Boundary and Oceanic Affairs, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/09/06/the-galwan-valley-stand-off
62,Yenya: Celebrations in Kathmandu,"September 5, 2020","“We will miss the charm of Indra Jatra this year. Hard to imagine when we will be comfortable among a crowd like this again to drink sweet thown from Swet Bhairav,” wrote my friend Paavan on her Instagram, along with a photo of herself at the Hatu Dyaa. Hatu Dyaa is the Newa name for Swet Bhairav. Hatu Hyakiu is the term that describes the thown, or sweet wine, trickling down the mouth of the deity during Indra Jatra. Jatra-goers throng the massive face of Swet Bhairav, clamouring for the wine; their jaws open, their tongue drawn out to catch the wine with as much as their mouths can expand. The drink sometimes trickles down their chins and all the way down the neck.  I’ve often thought of this as an act of receiving. Without holding back. Without shame. Unlike so many other occasions when you might be taunted for your need for a drink or for asking, there’s no shame during this festival. You open your mouth wide and receive, your face turned towards the sky, sometimes, the drizzles mingling with the wine, making its way into your system—for we’re at the very end of monsoon in the Valley.  Thinking of this festival conjures in my mind sounds, smells and the awkwardness of strangers pressing against you, while you suck in your breath, trying to hold yourself away as farthest as possible from the touch, even in knowing that being shoved around by the revelers is a part of being at a jatra.  For as long as I can remember, if I have been in Kathmandu in September, I’ve always been at Indra Jatra. With my parents as a child and on my own as an adult. You’re never alone at this festival because you always run into friends, mostly photojournalists. But you also run into yourself constantly, in your contact with strangers. Strangers can sometimes push you closer to yourself, as you embrace your body more closely in a crowd to keep yourself from being touched, brushed against. These things can happen without intent, too, but also with intent. And so it feels like a time you’re out there, gathering yourself more tightly than ever.  But jatra or no jatra, we’re all holding ourselves now, even within the walls of our own homes. And we’re nostalgic for a hundred things related to touch, but also for events like this one, that Paavan calls “mero favourite”. And it is my favourite too, so I instantly write a comment on her post.  My brother has often asked me why I would go to this jatra on my own every year. I initially thought I liked how invisible I could be as I drifted amidst the throngs of people doing their own thing. But year after year, as I worked as a journalist, talking to more and more people about the festival, a completely new interest in the festival began to emerge in me.  I’m a fan of the untamed and this jatra is just that. Look at the fierceness in the Majipaa Lakhey and look at Hatu Dyaa! This festival is a manifestation of everything Dionysiac! The jatra has historically drawn masked dancing troupes from all around the Valley. From Bhaktapur, Kirtipur, Ichangu and other places in the vicinity. The troupes walk hours to come perform in the courtyards around the Kathmandu Durbar Square—their head gear, their musical instruments and all. Within Kathmandu City itself, every single community has been assigned a task at the festivities. And over the centuries, they’ve continued to perform it, competing to make their performance shine. If the lead musicians in the processions are the Shahis, the Saapu community from Kilagaal move the Pulukishi. If the Ranjitkaars of Majipaat bear the responsibility of the Lakhey, the Pancha Buddhas are performed by the Bajracharyas.  As monsoon withdraws it would also be a time to set aside fieldwork and that’s where revelry comes in. The Yenya, or the Celebration of/in Kathmandu, was when the communities came together every year to make merry together. It has been a time for show of management skills, with each community managing their own responsibility best and taking to the streets to have fun with whatever apparatuses their ancestors had invented and placed a claim on for their community.  The spirit of this festival has also been at the heart of openness to change. It has constantly improvised itself over the years, beginning from introducing the Nanichayau (ref to A time called Indra Jatra by Prateebha Tuladhar, TKP), dedicated to the best aloo chop maker in the city, to the day set aside for women to drag the chariots, to a day dedicated to women drinking from Hatu Dyaa, their hair hanging limp behind them, as they jostle for their turns.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/as-it-is/2020/09/05/yenya-celebrations-in-kathmandu
63,Custodians of injustice,"September 3, 2020","Not long ago, at the height of the Maoist insurgency, thousands of people were taken into police custody and military barracks as suspected Maoists. The Bhairavnath Battalion, right in the heart of the Kathmandu Valley, had earned notoriety as a black hole of injustice—many who were taken through the gates of the barracks as suspects never returned. Some of them returned as corpses, others as half-dead souls crippled for life, physically and psychologically. Years later, the Maoists joined mainstream politics and formed or toppled governments, joining their necks with some among the old guard they had considered class enemies during the insurgency.  What they have forgotten in the course of the past decade and a half of mainstream politics is the fact that many of their comrades and members of the general public who were taken into the dark chambers of police custody and military barracks are yet to return—and are probably long dead within their walls. This rings true for the other major parties in Nepali politics today whose cadre disappeared without a trace in custody even as they fought against the party-less Panchayat system and even the Rana regime. Even in republican Nepal, impunity remains the bête noire of justice and democracy.  The impunity with which security agencies kill or maim the individuals they take into their custody as suspects has seen a repetition in the recent death of Bijay Mahara, a 19-year-old from Garuda Municipality in Rautahat, who came out of police custody as a corpse on August 26 after alleged torture. Bijay was one of the seven youths who were arrested on August 19 as suspects in the murder of Niranjan Ram, a fellow local teenager. While police claim Mahara died of medical complications in the course of treatment for a kidney ailment, his family claims he was tortured in custody. The family supports its claim with a video in which Mahara spoke, just prior to his death at Narayani Sub-Regional Hospital in Birgunj, about being tortured by plainclothes police and forced to confess to killing Niranjan Ram.  The Ministry of Home Affairs on Tuesday suspended police inspector Nabin Kumar Singh and head constable duo Feroz Miya Dhuniya and Mannu Kumar Singh for their alleged involvement in Mahara's death. But Mahara is only the latest victim of an alleged custodial death. On June 10, Shambhu Sada, a 23-year-old truck driver who had turned himself in to the police after he killed a woman in a traffic incident, died in police custody in Dhanusha. On June 20 last year, police allegedly killed Kumar Paudel, a member of a Maoist splinter group, in custody. On July 22, park rangers and soldiers guarding Chitwan National Park allegedly killed Raj Kumar Chepang, a 24-year-old man who had gone to the jungle to collect snails. Examples abound of incidents of alleged torture and eventual killing of inmates with complete impunity as perpetrators get away without any action while the government shuts the mouths of victims' families with compensation.

64,Show me the numbers,"September 3, 2020","As a people, we love rituals, be it Indra Jatra rites or the everyday rounds of temples in the morning. A new ritual has now imprinted itself on our minds. This one occurs every evening around 4 pm, when the Health Ministry spokesperson reads out new Covid-19 figures for the day. We wait with bated breath, keep our fingers crossed, and mentally compare the numbers to the previous day. The Nepali media has latched on to this daily ritual with a finesse. As the numbers are announced by the spokesperson, I can imagine a reporter diligently filing their copy, repeating the ministry’s words, but little else. The news reports are all predictable: new cases, total PCR tests in the last 24 hours, and those who’ve been discharged. On most news sites, there is a tally of the total number of cases, fatalities and global caseload. But what about the weekly rise in cases? A month-by-month comparison? Which districts have reported new infections? How many cases in each district? What is our recovery rate? And are we going through a second wave, or is the first wave still ongoing? What sort of statistical inference can we pull from the data? And can we tell stories about Nepal’s experience with Covid-19 through the numbers?  This pandemic is probably one of the most closely watched events by statisticians across the world. After all, rarely have such volumes of data been generated around a single event which stretches across time and space. Public interest is equally high; numbers matter more than ever. But here in Nepal, it is perplexing that little to no analysis of the pandemic exists in the public domain.  Ideally, every newsroom needs a numbers person, someone who can cut through the clutter to deliver precise data analysis and interpretation—not just of Covid-19, but of GDP, maternity health indicators, rise in foreign employment and remittances, number of students studying abroad, and tourist arrivals and departures. For example, the Finance Ministry expects the GDP to grow by 7 percent this year, but the World Bank projects the growth at 1.8 percent. What explains the disparity? Which figure should we trust?  Ten years ago, when I worked in this paper’s newsroom, it was difficult to find someone adept with numbers (admittedly, we may not have searched hard enough). It’s surprising, however, that Nepali newsrooms have not yet internalised the importance of data-driven reportage a decade later.  To me, such neglect is symptomatic of a larger malaise. It is partly social; we do not value numbers as a society. Math and the sciences are a pedagogical hurdle to overcome, unless one wishes to become an engineer. Part of it is systemic. Our governments have always been opaque, and digging into numbers is the easiest way to pin down governments. It’s therefore much easier to not release data, and anybody looking into numbers in Nepal knows how difficult it is to get even basic information. Part of it is also a weak orientation towards data, the lack of ability to absorb the numbers and go beyond just what a ministry, organisation or policymaker says, to run the numbers in one’s mind and imagine what they mean beyond the surface. Publishers have never invested in such specialisations to begin with. And part of it has to do with society’s outlook towards data and science which, by extension, defines how our media internalises and presents evidence-based reason, or counters false claims made by public figures.  Columnists usually hesitate to present a critique of the media—‘biting the hand that feeds us’ et al. But more than five months into the pandemic, it is extraordinary that one needs to dig deep into the ministry’s website to find a simple daily progression chart. Further, individuals or volunteer groups have done a basic analysis of the pandemic in Nepal by themselves. Imagine what could happen if these individuals had newsroom resources at their disposal?  This is not to say the media isn’t trying; there have been a few reports in this newspaper and others that have tried to tackle the numbers. But on the whole, the Nepali media’s Covid-19 reportage has been lacking in hard data analysis from the very start. As I said, the issue is systemic; our newsrooms are oriented more towards reportage, and less towards analysis. Both need to run together. Journalists have to be immersed in a daily news cycle while taking the long view of an event. Here, the publisher is equally responsible; unless they invest in such journalism, it is unlikely the reader will get any. Publishers need to hire individuals who specialise in such analysis to deliver a clearer picture. The media certainly faces fiduciary pressures, but journalism has to evolve as well. Reporting verbatim without cross-verifying and analysing reduces the media to being megaphones; they may amplify the information, but it does not achieve much else.

65,Grand old conspiracy theorists,"September 3, 2020","In the summer of 1945, the Allied policy of demanding unconditional surrender in World War II became the subject of intense debate in the United States. In a way, it has remained so ever since, tracking with Americans’ changing attitudes about the Cold War and post-Cold War interventions in the Middle East. In fact, the Republican Party’s own shifting positions on the issue of unconditional surrender during WWII offer a revealing glimpse of the party’s internal divisions and collective character. During WWII, the GOP’s hot-and-cold relationship with President Franklin D Roosevelt’s war policy reflected a mix of principled opposition, political opportunism, and the lack of internal consensus. Announced in January 1943, the unconditional-surrender policy was bound to be controversial simply because it had been conceived by Roosevelt. A quintessentially New Deal programme, its goal was to nurture economically broad-based democracy in societies that had previously pursued conquest and subjugation. To US conservatives, this project was an example of liberal ideology run amok. Seeing little reason to extend liberalism to imperial Japan, they demanded changes to the policy following Roosevelt’s death in April 1945 and Germany’s surrender the following month. Most Republicans—East Coast internationalists and pre-war isolationists alike—warned that efforts to reform Japanese society could not succeed. By late May, they had come to believe that a public modification of US war aims would induce Japan’s surrender. The most important ‘clarification’ (the term preferred by conservatives) was to assure the Japanese that their emperor could remain on the throne. Time was running out. The Russians were set to join the Pacific war in August, and US landings in Japan were planned for November. Conservatives hoped that a concession on the issue of the emperor would prevent a Soviet occupation of Northeast Asia and spare the Americans a costly invasion. The debate intensified, with Republicans from both camps lobbying US President Harry Truman to modify the unconditional-surrender policy. But Truman, unmoved, refused to offer the emperor any guarantee. On July 26, the Allies warned the Japanese that they faced imminent and utter destruction if they continued the war. But the Japanese would not budge. The end came swiftly. On August 6, the first atomic bomb was detonated above Hiroshima. On August 8, the Soviets declared war on Japan. The next day, a second atomic device instantly killed 39,000 inhabitants of Nagasaki. On August 14, Japan surrendered, subjecting Emperor Hirohito and his people to the authority of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, US General Douglas MacArthur. Five days later, the Chicago Tribune, the media megaphone of the Republican anti-interventionists, published an article by one of its reporters, Walter Trohan, claiming that in January 1945, MacArthur had sent Roosevelt a top-secret report showing that the Japanese were willing to surrender. The report had mysteriously disappeared when it reached Washington, DC, but Trohan assured readers it was genuine. Adding more fuel to the fire, former Republican President Herbert Hoover, an ardent supporter of modification, contended that communist sympathisers in the State Department had prevented Truman from telling the Japanese they could keep their emperor. In May 1951, after a lull of five years, this line of speculation received another boost during a Senate inquiry into Truman’s dismissal of MacArthur. Using what have since come to be known as ‘alternative facts’, some Republican senators claimed that Hirohito had tried to surrender to the Allies as early as February 1945—a month after the alleged disappearance of MacArthur’s report. Hirohito’s efforts were thwarted, they insisted, by fellow travellers in Washington who used unconditional surrender to prolong the war and allow the Soviets to overrun Manchuria and aid the Chinese Communists. This conspiracy theory was part of a broader Republican attack on Democrats for supposedly ‘losing’ China. Most adherents were isolationist holdovers who had alleged that Roosevelt provoked Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. In this telling, the unconditional-surrender policy was the coup de grâce of Roosevelt’s diabolical Pearl Harbour plot. But during the 1950s, the GOP came to be dominated by internationalists who had little interest in re-examining the end of the war or questioning the use of atomic weapons, which had become the foundation of US defence policy. Marginalised, the anti-interventionists kept the conspiracy theory alive within far-right redoubts, publishing jeremiads with titles like While You Slept, The Enemy at His Back, and ‘Hiroshima: Assault on a Beaten Foe’, an article in National Review by the avowed Roosevelt hater and eventual Holocaust denier Harry Elmer Barnes. By the mid-1960s, the unconditional-surrender policy was being criticised anew, this time by leftist historians appraising America’s role in the Cold War in light of the escalation in Vietnam. Some argued that Truman had stuck to unconditional surrender because he wanted to use the atomic bombs to intimidate the Soviet Union. By the mid-1990s, this view had become so prevalent in academe that it was incorporated into the Smithsonian Institution’s exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the war’s end. The revisionists provoked howls of protest from defenders of the Greatest Generation and, ironically, from many Republicans. But the conspiracy theory survived on the far right in such locales as the Institute for Historical Review, the headquarters for Holocaust deniers, and the John Birch Society. In 1995, the Birchers added a new wrinkle, arguing that conspirators had convinced Truman to oppose concessions and use the atomic bombs because they hoped that, faced with the terrifying destructiveness of nuclear weapons, Americans would surrender their sovereignty to the United Nations to prevent a nuclear Armageddon. By that point, however, much had changed since the days when Republicans questioned America’s ability to transform a society after regime change. In 2003, President George W Bush and his supporters cited the successful occupation of Japan as proof that the US would be able to democratise Iraq. Two weeks into that invasion, Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld announced that the US was seeking Saddam Hussein’s unconditional surrender. It would be tempting to conclude that the GOP’s opposition to the WWII-era unconditional-surrender policy, forgotten for so long, is of little relevance today. But the GOP of 2020 is no longer the party of Dwight Eisenhower or Bush. Once again, it is a hive of conspiracy theorists, egged on by a president to whom the party’s voters have unconditionally surrendered.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/09/03/grand-old-conspiracy-theorists
66,Let the data sink in,"September 3, 2020","Nepal has recorded 12 new deaths and 1,120 new cases in the last 24 hours. In the last 43 days alone, since the government 'lifted the lockdown' on July 21, the country has seen 211 deaths and 23,655 cases. But the regime, it seems, is intent on washing its hands of the pandemic. If we analyse the government data from the end of July till last week, there is a clear indication of a gradual rise in the percent-positive rate in the country. The percent-positive rate tells us the current level of virus transmission and whether enough testing is being done and as such, helps the government and public health agencies measure the severity of an outbreak and limitations in testing. If we look at the percent-positive rate and the number of hospitalisation and ICU admissions in the country over the last four weeks, it is clear that the risk levels have actually increased. The percent-positive rate which stood at 3.46 percent in the week of July 25-31 has jumped to 7.63 percent in the week of August 22-28. This higher rate would indicate two things—if the number of positive tests is high or if the number of tests is low. The government must let this data sink in, and it must continue to crunch the numbers to make informed decisions. The World Health Organisation recommends a 5 percent-positive rate or lower for at least two weeks, provided that the surveillance for suspected cases is comprehensive before adjusting public health and social measures in the context of Covid-19. As per the UN body’s epidemiological criteria, it also recommends a ‘decline in the number of hospitalisation and ICU admissions of confirmed cases for at least two weeks and at least 80 percent of cases are from contact lists which can be linked to identified clusters’.  An assessment of the aforementioned criteria, together with an evaluation of the health system capacity and existing surveillance system, would give us a clear picture of the Covid-19 situation in the country. The data would then enable the government and public health agencies to implement or adjust public health and social measures accordingly, and help avoid uninformed decisions which could put public sacrifice to waste and endanger lives. Epidemiologists and infectious disease medical doctors have long said that there is growing evidence of community transmission of the virus; and without expanded testing, we will not know for certain the true scale of transmission of the virus. Meanwhile, the government has done little besides dismissing these concerns and imposing restrictions in more than half of the country, but data shows that this two-week window or extended restrictions to contain the spread of the disease has failed as the number of new cases and deaths continue to escalate. The recovery rate, according to government data, has also declined to 55.9 percent as of Wednesday, from over 70 percent before 21 July.

67,How to spot a genius,"September 2, 2020","It has been a while since we heard from Donald J Trump about what a ‘stable genius’ he is. His claim to his supposed brilliance comes first and foremost from his having attended an Ivy League university although his own sister believes he cheated his way in. Trump also boasts about having made heaps of money out of the real estate empire he inherited from his father, before branching out into the hospitality business while dabbling with professional sports, beauty pageants, aviation and a university, not to mention a non-profit foundation. His detractors say all of these were failed enterprises and he managed to stay afloat only by gaming the system, which he himself has admitted to. But to his supporters his genius is unquestioned, particularly having managed all that and become a reality TV star as well as the president of the United States. But Trump now has competition in the genius sphere, and that, too, from Nepal. I am referring to one Professor Dr Upendra Kumar Koirala, who comes with a resume as long and as varied as Trump’s. A college teacher who catapulted to becoming general manager of Nepal Food Corporation in the mid-1990s, he has served consecutively as campus chief of Mahendra Morang Campus and of the Post-Graduate Campus in Biratnagar, executive chairperson of Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC), deputy chairperson of Higher Secondary Education Board, vice-chancellor of Mid-Western University, and is now the presumptive chairperson of the state-owned Rastriya Banijya Bank, the largest financial institution in Nepal. He is, seemingly, someone who has been able to strike that most elusive balance between theory and practice. Except that, like Trump, his every appointment has been marred by controversy. Of course, none of this would have come to light had it not been for Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokhrel’s name being dragged in with the latest near-appointment. It turns out that Pokhrel’s son is married to Koirala’s daughter. Amid charges of nepotism, Pokhrel is said to have asked that the appointment be kept in abeyance for now. Koirala for his part is adamant that he was chosen because of, for want of a better term, his genius since it can only be that superior brain of his that has had successive ministers and prime ministers in thrall of him over a quarter of a century. ‘Yeah, right!’ seems to be the only possible response to such brazen dissimulation. From what Koirala’s former colleagues have said about him, he is quite capable of navigating political channels on his own and his family ties to Pokhrel appear almost incidental. In the current cabinet, besides Pokhrel, he apparently is also pally with the prime minister, the finance minister and the education minister. As he himself has said, he headed the Food Corporation even before Pokhrel became a relative. Yet, even the duo should find it difficult to ignore the more than a hint of nepotism in the fact that Koirala was given charge of the NOC when Pokhrel was the departmental minister. As an intellectual, as he proudly calls himself, surely Koirala must have come across the old saying: ‘Caesar’s wife must be above suspicion’. Even if one were to accept that there was no one more capable than him, bowing to the well-established protocol of avoiding conflict of interest, Koirala should have refused that appointment outright so long as his son’s father-in-law was going to remain his boss. In defence of his record there, Koirala pointed out in an interview that the slogan painted on NOC tankers, proclaiming ‘Purity in petroleum products is our motto’, was his idea even though that hardly sounds like the handiwork of a management whiz kid since we continue to suffer one of the worst instances of fuel adulteration in the world. In all fairness to Pokhrel, granting favours to close relatives is not limited either to him or to his party. That has been the bane of the Nepali polity for centuries and has continued in the post-1990 era, regardless of who is in charge. To recall a book that has been both praised and vilified, Dor Bahadur Bista’s Fatalism and Development, it all has to do with our particular social structure that we look out for people who are ‘our own’, the afno manchhe syndrome. As he puts it: ‘Afno manchhe is the term used to designate one’s inner circle of associates…Academic qualification, training, background, working discipline, integrity of character and other such attributes are not as important or helpful as the sense of belonging to a particular circle. …A member of one’s own circle is naturally preferred, even without a particular capacity to perform in some organizational role. The most important asset for anyone is not what you know, but who you know’. Bista’s book was published around the same time that the political parties came to power, riding a wave of enthusiasm after the 1990 People’s Movement and the hope that they would put an end to the feudal holdovers such as the afno manchhe system. The same hope was held in 2006 as well. But we all know how that has turned out as well. For all his unfiltered and controversial views in the book, Bista also claimed that ‘[a]fno manchhe is a critical Nepali institution’, and that is something that has been latched on to mainly by foreigners to explain all the woes afflicting the country. Looking out for afno manchhe is certainly not a uniquely Nepali phenomenon, except that unlike here, when it involves close relatives, a strict line is usually drawn when it involves close relatives (something the other genius, Trump, has also blatantly disregarded). That is perhaps why similar practices escape carrying the same connotation such as the most obvious old boys’ network, most insidiously extant in Britain. Likewise with the more innocuous-sounding ‘social capital’, which has been defined as ‘networks together with shared norms, values and understandings that facilitate co-operation within or among groups…Shared norms, values and understandings relate to the subjective dispositions and attitudes of individuals and groups…The cultural context in which shared attitudes, values and knowledge are transmitted from generation to generation is important in understanding the choices of individuals and groups in relation to co-operation’. In Nepal, social capital often boils down to networks linked to each other by family and ethnicity, and that is where the afno manchhe are drawn from, mostly if not exclusively. Since entry into these networks is not open to all, it is but natural many people would find themselves in the ‘wrong networks’, i.e., in networks that do not provide the same returns as belonging to the ‘right’ ones. Research in the American context has shown that those from the dominant groups, meaning males and whites, tend to be part of more useful networks as opposed to women, Hispanics and blacks.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/09/02/how-to-spot-a-genius
68,The post-capitalist hit of the summer,"September 2, 2020","On August 12, something extraordinary happened. The news broke that, in the first seven months of 2020, the United Kingdom’s economy had suffered its largest contraction ever (a drop in national income exceeding 20 percent). The London Stock Exchange reacted with a rise in the FTSE 100 by more than 2 percent. On the same day, when the United States was beginning to resemble a failed state, not merely a troubled economy, the S&P 500 hit a record high. To be sure, financial markets have long rewarded misery-enhancing outcomes. Bad news for a firm’s workers—planned layoffs, for example—is often good news for its shareholders. But when the bad news engulfed most workers simultaneously, equity markets always fell, owing to the reasonable expectation that, as the population tightened its belt, all income, and thus average profits and dividends, would be squeezed. The logic of capitalism was not pretty, but it was comprehensible. Not anymore. There is no capitalist logic to the developments that culminated on August 12. For the first time, a widespread expectation of diminished revenues and profits led to—or at least did not impede—a sustained buying frenzy in London and New York. And this is not because speculators are betting that the UK or the US economies have hit bottom, making this a great time to buy shares. No, for the first time in history, financiers actually don’t give a damn about the real economy. They can see that Covid-19 has put capitalism in suspended animation. They can see the disappearing profit margins. They can see the tsunami of poverty and its long-term effects on aggregate demand. And they can see how the pandemic is revealing and reinforcing deep pre-existing class and racial divisions. Speculators see all this but deem it irrelevant. And they are not wrong. Ever since Covid-19 collided with the enormous bubble governments have been using to re-float the financial sector since 2008, booming equity markets became compatible with wholesale economic implosion. It was a historically significant moment, marking a subtle but discernible transition from capitalism to a peculiar type of post-capitalism. But let us begin at the beginning. Before capitalism, debt appeared at the very end of the economic cycle. Under feudalism, production came first. Peasants toiled in the lord’s fields, and distribution followed the harvest, with the sheriff collecting the lord’s share. Part of this share was then monetised when the lord sold it. Only then did debt emerge, when the lord would lend money to borrowers (often including the king). Capitalism reversed the order. Once labour and land had been commodified, debt was necessary before production even began. Landless capitalists had to borrow to lease land, workers, and machines. The terms of these leases determined income distribution. Only then could production begin, yielding revenues whose residual was the capitalists’ profit. Thus, debt powered capitalism’s early promise. But it was not until the Second Industrial Revolution that capitalism could re-shape the world in its image. Electromagnetism gave rise to the first networked companies, producing everything from power generation stations and the electricity grid to light bulbs for every room. These companies’ gargantuan funding needs begat the megabank, along with a remarkable capacity to create money out of thin air. The agglomeration of megafirms and megabanks created a technostructure that usurped markets, democratic institutions, and the mass media, leading first to the Roaring Twenties, and then to the crash of 1929. From 1933 to 1971, global capitalism was centrally planned under different iterations of the New Deal governance framework, including the war economy and the Bretton Woods system. As that framework was swept away in the mid-1970s, the Technostructure, cloaked in neoliberalism, recovered its powers. A 1920s-like spate of ‘irrational exuberance’ followed, culminating in the 2008 global financial crisis. To re-float the financial system, central banks channelled waves of dirt-cheap liquidity to the financial sector, in exchange for universal fiscal austerity that limited spending by lower- and middle-income households. Unable to profit from austerity-hit consumers, investors became dependent on central banks’ constant liquidity injections—an addiction with serious side effects for capitalism itself. Consider the following chain reaction: The European Central Bank extends new liquidity to Deutsche Bank at almost zero interest. To profit from it, Deutsche Bank must lend it on, though not to the ‘little people’ whose diminished circumstances have weakened their repayment ability. So, it lends to, say, Volkswagen, which is already awash with savings because its executives, fearing insufficient demand for new, high-quality electric cars, postponed crucial investments in new technologies and well-paying jobs. Even though Volkswagen’s bosses do not need the extra cash, Deutsche Bank offers them such a low interest rate that they take it and immediately use it to buy Volkswagen shares. Naturally, the share price skyrockets and, with it, the Volkswagen executives’ bonuses (which are linked to the company’s market capitalisation). From 2009 to 2020, such practices helped prize stock prices away from the real economy, resulting in widespread corporate zombification. This was the state capitalism was in when Covid-19 arrived. By hitting consumption and production simultaneously, the pandemic forced governments to replace incomes at a time when the real economy had the least capacity adequately to invest in the generation of non-financial wealth. As a result, central banks were called upon to boost even more magnificently the debt bubble that had already zombified the corporations. The pandemic has reinforced that which has been undermining the foundation of capitalism since 2008: the link between profit and capital accumulation. The current crisis has revealed a post-capitalist economy in which the markets for real goods and services no longer coordinate economic decision-making, the current Technostructure (comprising Big Tech and Wall Street) manipulates behaviour at an industrial scale, and the demos is ostracised from our democracies.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/09/02/the-post-capitalist-hit-of-the-summer
69,Work must go on,"September 2, 2020","Nepal has finally allowed resumption of international flights beginning Tuesday, September 1, after a halt of over five months. Thousands of Nepalis who have been unable to return to Nepal will also get relief. Similarly, thousands of those who have been confined to Nepal due to the absence of flights will be able to travel abroad. This has also come as a big relief for major infrastructure projects that have had to halt construction work due to the inability to bring in consultants from abroad.  The Covid-19 pandemic has delayed dozens of projects from both private and government sectors that were on their final lap, including Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa. Many infrastructure projects are reported to have suffered due to the lockdown and ban on international flights because foreign technical manpower and experts could not be brought in. The work of several hydro projects has been delayed. The Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project in Dolakha, Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line project and Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation are some major schemes where work has been delayed due to constraints in bringing equipment and technical workers from abroad.  In the case of the international airport in Bhairahawa, foreign technical manpower that was set to arrive to install the runway lighting system and other equipment reportedly got stuck due to the halt in international flights. Upper Tamakoshi, the country’s largest hydropower plant, is also awaiting foreign technical manpower for the commissioning and testing, the final phase before production begins. Experts say as much as 1,500 megawatts of electricity would have been connected to the national grid had the pandemic not unsettled the timetable of the hydro projects. The delay in several such major projects, while causing cost overruns, will also impact the economy negatively.  Media reports from various parts of the world show construction work has moved ahead in full swing despite initial hiccups in the wake of the pandemic. India has said vital railway infrastructure projects including high-speed corridors, dedicated freight corridors, signalling projects and projects for launching new trains will go on as planned even in the midst of the pandemic. The construction of the infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has also not halted. Several states in the United States went ahead with construction work, calling it ‘essential business’ even as other business sectors were hit hard by the pandemic. So much so that work on the US-Mexico border wall was reported to have proceeded despite the pandemic when much of the economic activities have slowed down. ",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2020/09/02/work-must-go-on
70,Panting of the pachyderms,"September 1, 2020","The month of Bhado (late-August and early-September) in much of Madhes is the season of kado (slush), when few dare to step out into muddy streets. When it rains, it pours; but when it's dry, fierce rays of the sun burn the skin. There isn't very much to do once the paddy transplantation is over in any case. There are few jackfruit or mangoes left unpicked in the orchards. Livestock has to be tethered and fed in the sheds to prevent them from straying into lush green paddies. Tractors take a break while their operators clean and grease the machine for the coming harvest season. It is during these times of late-monsoon lethargy that tellers of tall tales do the rounds of villages, spinning yarns about their remarkable deeds of the past or airy-fairy plans for the future. In Maithili, such a fabulist is called batbanauna. Fabulists are said to be endowed with an imagination that is unfettered by the laws of logic and probability. Language is a medium of performance for them rather than the means of communication. They use idioms and proverbs, rather than facts and figures, to support their arguments. Prime Minister KP Oli fibs with the confidence of an accomplished narrator. Supremo Oli repeatedly insists that the rhino should remain a gaida in the English language. His folksy repertoire consists of proverbs such as 'if a cow has eaten, let it be; if a bahun has taken, so be it' that explicitly strengthen supposed sacredness and assumed superiority of the said categories. For quite a while, the Supremo's characterisation of Covid-19 was similar to that of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's dismissal of the 'little flu'. He then went on to extol the virtues of Himalayan air that somehow made the immune system of relatively malnourished Nepalis stronger. While he himself relies on modern medicine and state of the art treatment for his ailments, the Supremo loves to recommend the power of home remedies such as ginger, turmeric and hot water to the public. Demagogic designs Recently, Oli excelled himself when he asked a television interviewer in all seriousness: ‘If turmeric can ward off evil eyes, why can't it do so to a mere virus?’. A lapsed Marxist-Leninist, he apparently has more faith in superstitious beliefs than in the prescriptions of science. Elaborating his ‘Oliological’ arguments, the Supremo claimed that there was a scarcity of turmeric in the world market due to its popularity in preventing and treating Covid-19. India alone produces almost three-fourth of all the turmeric in the world and remains its biggest consumer. South Asian communities everywhere use the condiment on an almost daily basis. Curcuma is said to possess some antimicrobial properties. That has given rise to the popularity of a brew called 'turmeric latte' among aficionados of health foods. Domestic and export demand for the herb in India is reported to be rising. But to relate it to antiviral properties requires some leap of faith. Rabble rousers, however, aren't too well known for truthfulness. Demagogues are proficient in resorting to the repetition of fallacies that are then said to be self-evident. Hindutva firebrand Pragya Singh Thakur in India claimed that cow urine cured her breast cancer, which goes on to show that she had not been taking full benefit of the supposedly preventive qualities of the holy faeces. Repetition is the reliable instrument in the armoury of demagogues. The Goebbelsian dictum of propaganda that repeated lies become the perceived truth is still true. Demagogues keep asserting the same falsehood again and again until listeners forget that the original claim was a complete fabrication. Few people remember any more that the prime minister served the prison term for his complicity in manslaughter rather than fighting for democracy. Democrats remained 'class enemies' for communists of all hues until the late-1980s when Ganesh Man Singh brought them into parliamentary politics. Like most demagogues, the Supremo loves to invent phoney numbers, enjoys circulating unsubstantiated stories, loathes intellectuals and falls back on nationalist rhetoric whenever he faces a challenge. Unlike patriotism, which is the love for one's country and critical attachment to its institutions, nationalism requires an out-group inside and an enemy outside to espouse hatred. The out-group for the Supremo Oli are the Madhesis and India is the external foe. He rushed two ordinances in order to split Madhes-based parties, which had to be hastily repealed when preempted with a merger between his main targets. Madhesis, however, have little fight left in them to challenge the ethnonational prejudices of the hegemonic community. Most of them appear to be resigned to their fate as inferior citizens for now. It's Oli's hostility towards India and Indians that is likely to damage the national interests of Nepal for a considerable time. Sooner or later, he would have to make way for a successor. Saddled with the legacy of demagogic diplomacy, such a person would have to deal with an indifferent United States, a patronising Europe, a demanding China, and most of all, a belligerent and authoritarian regime in India. Populist playbook Up until the late-1990s, strategists in New Delhi happily humoured the permanent establishment of Nepal. Their assumption was that beyond a point, Nepalis would never go against the interests of their fellow-Hindus. Such a belief crashed with the hijacking of IC-814 from Kathmandu. Any faith that has remained in the capacity of Nepal's law enforcement agencies in protecting its interests evaporated after the 2001 Narayanhiti Massacre. Somewhat tellingly, LK Advani and Jaswant Singh, politicos that had to handle the fallout of failures of security agencies in Kathmandu, stand sidelined from the contemporary Indian mainstream. Singh continues to suffer from the trauma of his political externalisation. Not only that, the Bharatiya Janata Party has also been getting increasingly regressive. With his obduracy during the 1979 fiasco, Atal Bihari Vajpayee made the founder of the political front of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Shyama Prasad Mookerjee appear somewhat liberal. By spearheading the campaign for the demolition of Babri Masjid, LK Advani proved that he was a step ahead of Vajpayee in furthering the agenda of Hindutva politics. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown that his Hindutva is stronger than that of both Vajpayee and Advani. Issues of widening public participation, guaranteeing fundamental freedoms, ensuring social justice, delivering the fruits of economic development to the doorsteps of the marginalised and celebrating the multiplicity of identities in the most diverse country of the world is no longer even the part of public discourse in the largest democracy in human history. Premier Modi has successfully shifted the focus away from Mahatma Gandhi's compassionate humanism to Savarkar's combative Hindutva; August 5 might as well be the new Indian Independence Day. If that sounds frightening, dealing with New Delhi under Amit Shah or Yogi Adityanath in the future would be even more challenging.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/09/01/panting-of-the-pachyderms
71,The cash cow is drying up,"September 1, 2020","The latest provisional data for the fiscal year 2019-20 released by the Nepal Rastra Bank provide interesting insights on the impact of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdowns on the economy. Almost all areas, except for the external sector, have been hit hard since the first lockdown began in late March. Specifically, unlike projections of a sharp drop, the data shows just a small deceleration in remittances. This has led some to argue that Nepal’s external sector is sound as well as resilient and that vulnerabilities are on the downside. However, the reality is that it only appears sound owing to a larger import contraction than export contraction, and slower than expected deceleration of remittances. Remittances are an important household coping strategy when faced with an adverse income or consumption shock. Migrant workers tend to use precautionary savings to remit more after such shocks. This should not be construed as a sign of resilience.  Still unstable A sudden supplies disruption was expected to hit imports and remittances, resulting in an improvement in the current account balance, which is a record of Nepal’s transactions with the rest of the world. Exports pretty much stalled after the pandemic spread globally. Imports, except for medical equipment and supplies, were also severely curtailed due to disruptions and logistical hurdles. Further, oil imports, which normally account for 15 percent of the total import bill, decreased on account of a drop in internal demand, particularly for transportation and development projects.  Declining global oil prices also contributed to a lower oil import bill. Consequently, imports decreased much faster than exports. For instance, in US dollar terms, merchandise exports and imports contracted by 7.9 percent and 18.9 percent, respectively. In a reversal of the previous trend, merchandise trade deficit actually dropped to 28.2 percent of the gross domestic product in 2019-20 from 37.1 percent of GDP in 2018/19. Similarly, the trade imbalance in services also improved as services import (which includes outbound travel and foreign educational expenses) decreased much more than services export (which includes inbound travel and tourism). A sharp contraction of imports but a small contraction of remittances (by just 3.4 percent) improved the current account balance. This is what the analysts meant when they argued that the external sector remained stable despite the adverse external environment. Meanwhile, the balance of payments reached a record $2.4 billion as a large contraction of imports but a lower than expected deceleration of remittances and an increase in foreign direct investment and foreign emergency loans all played crucial roles. Similarly, gross foreign exchange reserves have also hit record levels. The Nepali rupee depreciated by 9.2 percent against the US dollar at the end of 2019-20. The improvement in the current account balance, a large balance of payments surplus and record foreign exchange reserves might have given a misplaced assurance that all is sound and stable. But regardless of the pandemic being contained or the country choosing to simply live with the virus, as the economy opens up after the lockdowns and supply chains are restored, the situation might quickly change.  Most prominently, the import of commodities (oil, food and raw materials) as well as intermediate capital goods will increase. Meanwhile, given the lack of price competitiveness, an unfavourable policy environment, distortionary incentives and generally subdued external demand, exports will likely not recover soon. Travel and tourism activities may not also recover quickly. These will deteriorate the tenuous external sector stability and put a strain on foreign exchange reserves. A short respite The problem will be compounded by the expected deceleration of remittance inflows. Apart from its positive effect on reducing poverty and boosting consumer demand, government revenue and financial sector liquidity, large remittance inflows have been a saving grace for external sector stability in the face of a large and growing trade deficit. The number of Nepali migrant workers has been continuously declining since 2014-15. The persistent deceleration of remittances will be coupled with a smaller expatriate workforce, with fewer outbound migrant workers and a reduction in the work hours of those already working abroad. There are three main reasons why remittances did not decelerate as expected in 2019-20. First, remittances tend to increase immediately after a shock in receiving countries. For instance, remittances increased by 12.2 percent in 2014-15 as migrant workers, drawing from their precautionary savings, remitted more income to their earthquake-affected families. However, the following fiscal it only grew by 0.8 percent. Second, the depreciation of the Nepali rupee against the US dollar also provides an incentive for migrant workers to remit more money. The rupee depreciated by 9.2 percent in mid-July 2020, much higher than 0.02 percent depreciation in mid-July 2019. Third, the use of formal banking channels to remit income has increased along with the rise in the number of money transfer agencies and the crackdown on informal inflows.

72,Work or perish,"September 1, 2020","Two news stories published in the past couple of days have put a spotlight on the plight of Nepali citizens, especially the poor and vulnerable who are often forced to take risks to earn a living in foreign lands as the state continues to turn its back on them. One, published in the Post in association with the Centre for Investigative Journalism-Nepal, explores how Nepalis who are injured or killed while working for American contractors in US war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq are often sent home with only token compensation—or none at all.  The other news is about Qatar raising minimum wage and lifting curbs on changing jobs for migrant workers. The Gulf nation, which is hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, has been invariably chided by rights bodies for exploiting migrant workers. But this time around, it has earned accolades by agencies like the United Nations and Amnesty International. Qatar is among the most favoured destinations for Nepali migrant workers and hosts around 400,000 Nepalis as per the latest Nepal Migration Report. The two news stories expose the contradiction that Nepalis seeking work in foreign destinations are confronted with: They risk losing their lives when they work in foreign labour destinations, but have no option but to work there and have to be happy if the destination country reforms its working conditions even if the reform is minuscule.  The lack of employment at home and the state’s absolute indifference towards its citizens abroad have for long put millions of poor Nepalis between a rock and a hard place. An estimated 1,500 Nepalis used to leave the country legally for jobs in the Persian Gulf, Malaysia and South Korea before the pandemic-induced lockdown. Then there are some ‘lucrative’ destinations that Nepal has banned for Nepali migrant workers but still attract the desperate Nepalis who reach there via alternative routes. Those destinations promise good remunerations but come with huge risks.  Chandra Pun Magar of Banke died last year in Kabul, Afghanistan while working for a US contractor when Taliban suicide bombers attacked the compound where US officials and the workers were housed. Kishor Singh Thakuri was wounded in his stomach from a bullet accidentally fired by American soldiers. Both were denied proper compensation. They were unaware of the legal procedures and lacked the wherewithal to challenge the pittance they were paid in compensation. But the Nepali state has been oblivious to such events concerning the lives of its citizens all along. Doha’s recent announcement to reform its labour laws, raise the minimum wage by 25 percent to 1,000 riyals ($275 or Rs32,203) a month and scrap the requirement for workers to get permission from their employers to change jobs are sure to receive appreciation in Nepal. After all, Nepali migrants workers’ sweat and blood in foreign lands like Qatar has helped the country’s economy remain afloat. Remittance accounts for around one-third of the country’s economy. But how the Nepali state fails to respond when its citizens are ill-treated or cheated in the destination countries needs no explanation. The recent erratic moves by the government regarding the Nepalis stranded in various countries after they lost their jobs to the pandemic show just how apathetic it is towards its citizens.  Despite pledges from several governments in the past, none has found a way to retain the workforce in the country. Poverty is a major factor that forces many Nepali youths to leave home. And out of desperation, some even choose to embark on risky journeys and land where their work is fraught with danger. There’s an urgent need for the government to check people’s illegal migration to work as mercenaries in war zones. ",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2020/09/01/work-or-perish
73,Two killers: Cities and centralism,"August 31, 2020","Paul Collier, one of the most famous development economists of our times and author of several bestselling books including The Bottom Billions (2007) and The Future of Capitalism (2017), equated British cities of the 1840s with killing fields. The industrial revolution (1780-1830) had triggered rapid industrialisation and urbanisation. The British rural population rushed to emerging megacities that had become new manufacturing hubs. A combination of inadequate urban infrastructure for the added population, pollution from coal-burning factories, cramped accommodations, poor quality of water supply, malnutrition and lack of proper personal hygiene etc. resulted in frequent outburst of cholera, often in epidemic scales, and scarlet fever. They killed hundreds of thousands of young migrants. Limited healthcare facilities then available were invariably overwhelmed by the speed of the contagions and the number of patients at any given time. The average life expectancy at birth in many large British cities (except London) then dropped to as low as 30 years at one point of time. Congested living At present, the world is in the ever-tightening grip of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Even after a hundred and eighty years, the cities of the world, sadly, continue to be the major killing fields from transmissions, like of Covid-19. The cities in the developing world, in particular, are turning out to be more vulnerable, as their fundamental condition is still comparable to the British cities of the 1840s. Urban migration has grown exponentially, even in developing and emerging economies. UNESCAP, a United Nations’ agency, estimates that India has around 139 million internal migrant workers employed in sectors like construction, hospitality and manufacturing. The apparel sector in Bangladesh has about four million migrant workers and Nepal has about two million. Long and severe Covid-19 induced lockdowns in these economies has impacted jobs and livelihoods of millions of these internal migrants. The urban-rural reverse migration during the initial days of lockdown and, lately, their re-entry into the cities has been an additional cause of the rapid spread of the virus. Many of these cities are densely populated with illegal settlements and without basic facilities like potable water, electricity and housing with the proper flow of air. For example, in the Dharavi slum area of Mumbai, India, on average, 270,000 people live in every square kilometre. In Nepal, according to a World Bank estimate, more than 50 percent among the urban population lives in slums or in cramped, shared accommodations. In these conditions, social distancing, a prerequisite to contain the coronavirus, becomes practically impossible. Awareness of these inhabitants is constrained by limited access to information and level of education. These have a telling effect on their social behaviour. This is exactly the reason why densely populated cities, including the Kathmandu Valley, are becoming the new hotspots of Covid-19 transmission. The Nepali state has also grossly underestimated the compulsion of this economically vulnerable section that needs to earn every day to survive. The state mechanism has failed to provide alternative means for survival, a must until the vulnerable can return to some gainful employment. The clandestine movements of urban migrants to find ways to survive—circumventing security barriers even during the lockdown—are only adding to the risk. Costly misses When Nepal first imposed a nationwide lockdown in the last week of March, the situation here seemed to be much safer than several other countries. One of the reasons for that psychological cushion was the sheer hope that the political leadership would learn from the experiences, good or bad, of other countries, and introduce containment measures that were proven in the highly affected areas of the world. But during the four-month-long lockdown, the government only managed to bungle everything—in procuring related healthcare materials, in managing quarantines and lockdowns, in adding testing and tracing facilities, and in equipping the hospitals adequately for critical care. The public healthcare system of Nepal is naturally overwhelmed, as well as being centred in the federal or provincial capitals. It is miserably understaffed, underfunded and grossly mismanaged. But, fortunately, as a boon of the free-market policies that the country in a brief stint of three years (1992-95) implemented, Nepal has an impressive network of private hospitals and medical schools spread across the country. The government, with timely and appropriate policies and operations guidelines, had the opportunity to utilise and mobilise these important resources. Even now, when the situation already looks dangerously precarious, the government with its deep-rooted ‘License Raj’ mindset is toying with a half-hearted approach towards utilising the readily available infrastructure, manpower and facilities that are in private hands. This is one very costly miss which the government must immediately reconsider. Further, the federal government did not adequately and wholeheartedly partner with both provincial and local governments in the fight against the virus. Local governments were and still are enthusiastic to contribute to the cause of virus containment. In fact, they are best placed to do so, if resources, technical support and clear guidelines were given. But the federal government has refused to budge from the idea of fully centralised control of procurement and order. As a result, the local government representatives who are dedicating their sincere efforts in every possible aspect of Covid-19 containment and cure measures have started to speak out about the complete lack of support of the federal government extended to them. On the contrary, the federal government, in the pretext of the pandemic, is infringing upon the decision-making authority of the local level, blatantly defying the spirit of fiscal federalism.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/08/31/two-killers-cities-and-centralism
74,Why all countries should contribute to ending global poverty,"August 31, 2020","Trillions of dollars have already been spent on the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and no one knows what the final bill will be. Is it possible to respond to a much longer crisis—global poverty—with even a fraction of these resources? Richer countries are currently committed to spending 0.7 percent of their gross national income (GNI) on international development aid. This target was established by the Pearson Commission in 1969, and approved in a United Nations General Assembly resolution the following year. Countries reached this agreement a half-century ago in a world in which global poverty was at very high levels. At the time, the world was justifiably perceived in binary terms: The North was wealthy, and the South was poor. Much has changed in the intervening 50 years. Some countries have met the 0.7 percent target, but many others have yet to do so. Many developing countries experienced rapid economic growth in the 2000s—not only China and India, but also a number of African countries. Although all gains are currently in jeopardy, prior to the pandemic, at least, the world had entered a new era, with fewer low-income countries. At the same time, the higher global ambitions set out in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), committed countries to end poverty in all its forms by 2030. A new era needs a new approach. The Covid-19 pandemic makes this need even more urgent. My colleagues and I propose a scaled financial commitment to development, with a twist: it should be universal across all countries, rich and poor. Before describing the proposal, it is necessary to ask what has changed since the 0.7 percent-of-GNI target was adopted. During this period, two ‘new middles’ emerged. The first is an increase in the number of middle-income countries—now home to much of the developing world’s population. In many of these countries, aid levels are already low relative to domestic resources and non-public international flows. At the other end of the spectrum, about 30 countries remain ‘stuck’ in terms of growth. These highly aid-dependent states are home to approximately 10 percent of the population of developing countries—not a ‘bottom billion’, but a bottom half-billion. The other ‘new middle’ comprises those who have escaped poverty, but remain vulnerable to falling back into it. This group, as we show, represents more than two-thirds of the developing world’s people. If measured using the World Bank’s definition of extreme poverty—living on $1.90 or less per day—global poverty has fallen (although the decline is more modest when China is excluded), and income has grown among many of the world’s poorest. Extreme poverty now affects only some 10 percent of the population in developing countries, down from around 50 percent 40 years ago. But poverty remains at startling levels when measured at the World Bank’s poverty thresholds of $3.20 and $5.50 per day. It is sobering to note that every 10 cents added to the poverty line increases the global headcount of the poor by 100 million. Moreover, the poverty count at $1.90 doubles when one considers multidimensional poverty, which includes health, education, and nutrition. When using a threshold that is associated with a permanent escape from the risk of future poverty—$13 per day in 2011 purchasing-power-parity terms—some 80 percent of the population in developing countries remains poor. Furthermore, poverty does not only occur in Sub-Saharan Africa and in fragile or conflict-affected states. It is widespread. In short, the second ‘new middle’ are those in developing countries living above the $1.90 poverty line, but below the $13 vulnerability-to-future-poverty threshold. Against this backdrop, and amid the global pandemic, our proposal calls for a ‘universal development commitment’ (UDC) from all countries—rich and poor alike. Given their aim of poverty eradication, the SDGs would inevitably be the core focus of any such UDC. One option for a UDC would be to institute a sliding scale. For example, high-income countries could keep the commitment at 0.7 percent of GNI, while upper-middle-income countries would contribute 0.35 percent. Lower-middle-income countries would earmark 0.2 percent of their GNI, with lower-income countries contributing just 0.1 percent. These are gross contributions, not net. In this scenario, the total finance available for development would amount to almost $500 billion per year. These additional resources could, in principle, lift the remaining approximately 750 million people out of $1.90-per-day poverty; end hunger and malnutrition for an estimated 1.5 billion people; end preventable child mortality; make primary and secondary schooling possible for all children; and provide access to safe and affordable drinking water for over one billion people, as well as providing adequate sanitation for more than two billion people. And in this scaled-contribution scenario, $200 billion would still remain available to support the achievement of other SDGs. Developing countries would gain by contributing, because a universal development commitment would lead to more resources for those countries overall. Moreover, and equally important, contributing would ensure that poorer countries have a voice in funds’ governance, whether symbolically, as a sign of their moral right to be heard, or physically, as members of the board deciding on priorities and policies.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/08/31/why-all-countries-should-contribute-to-ending-global-poverty
75,Care for the frontliners,"August 30, 2020","On Saturday, Kabita Pathak, a doctor at the Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Pokhara, had a surprise visitor at the isolation centre where she has been staying for the past one week as she is on Covid-19 duty. The visitor had brought several packets of tiffin for her and her colleagues. It turned out that her friends at ‘What The Book Club’, a local readers’ group, had prepared the food to express their gratitude for the excellent work Dr Pathak and her colleagues have been doing in our collective fight against the pandemic. In the evening, the elated doctor tweeted photos of herself and her friends cherishing the kheer, puri and achar her friends had lovingly prepared for them. Little gestures matter. What would have happened if Dr Pathak's friends hadn't sent her the food? Nothing much. She'd go on doing her work as usual. But what if the friends had promised her the food in advance and never delivered? Maybe she would take the words of her friends with a pinch of salt the next time they made such promises. That is what the government has done to thousands of frontline workers like Dr Pathak and her colleagues across the country: It promised them risk allowances but never delivered on them. The government, in the ‘Hazard Allowance Management Order for Human Resources Involved in the Treatment of Covid-19 Infection’ published in the Nepal Gazette, announced it would provide risk allowances, up to 100 percent of the salary, to frontline workers including doctors, nurses, paramedics, lab workers, ambulance drivers and helpers, security personnel, sanitation workers, and administrative staff among others. It was not alone in announcing such allowances. Governments across the world have announced risk allowances to their frontline workers and delivered on them. But a large number of the frontline workers in the country complain they have yet to receive their salaries in time, not to mention the allowances.  A risk allowance is an acknowledgement of the enormous hazard the frontline workers face in the fight against the pandemic. It is a gesture of gratitude for the extraordinary grit and kindness they exhibit in the face of uncertainty. It encourages them to keep doing their work diligently and efficiently. It is also a fulfilment of society’s responsibility to give back to the warriors who have been putting their lives at stake even as they work for weeks without being able to visit their homes and families.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2020/08/30/care-for-the-frontliners
76,"Self-quarantine, Kathmandu style","August 30, 2020","When my father returned from Lhasa in 1954, he didn't go bounding up the stairs to hug his dear family members, whom he had not seen for six years. In fact, he wasn't even allowed to go higher than the first floor, much less touch any of the people in the house. For the next five days, he slept alone in a spare room. The kitchen was off-limits to him, and he ate separately while the rest of the family had their meals sitting down together on a long mat. My father had to wash the dirty dishes himself too. Such was the cultural practice among Newar merchants returning home from Tibet in those days. Since the traders had journeyed in faraway lands and consorted with people from unknown places, they could have been contaminated—both spiritually and physically. So, custom required that they keep social distance until they had completed the stipulated rituals to cleanse themselves. The practice is known as nee chwanegu in Nepal Bhasa which, in today's parlance, would be called self-quarantine. People were reminded of this ancient rule in the Kathmandu Valley after everyone began talking about isolation and quarantine following the novel coronavirus outbreak. Renewed interest in this half-forgotten tradition has also sparked a debate whether it was a precaution to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases, or state-imposed social behaviour intended to assert the domination of the ruling classes. Not all returning travellers had to practice nee chwanegu. People coming back from India were exempt from this rule, except for being made to drink chiretta brew for its anti-malarial properties, as the disease was endemic in the hot southern plains. They did not need to obtain any paperwork from the government allowing them to rejoin society either. But returning Lhasa merchants, after finishing their isolation period, had to obtain a piece of paper saying that they had 'got their caste back', which they had supposedly lost during their journey across the Himalaya. The paperwork, some say, is evidence of discrimination by the state against travellers to certain regions.  The cultural practice of nee chwanegu had been loosened a bit when my father returned from Lhasa in 1954. It was not as strict as in the old days, when merchants would self-isolate for 15 days outside their home. Now, you could stay in your own house. The isolation period, too, had also been shortened. Society had devised an imaginative arrangement under which family members could share the mandatory isolation period. When my father underwent nee chwanegu, my mother and aunt also observed the prescribed rules, and so he had to self-isolate for only five days—the two women each fulfilling the obligations concurrently for five days on his behalf. They had only one meal a day and took a daily bath. A day before the concluding ceremony, they were forbidden to eat anything. The family priest came to the house to conduct a Buddhist service. Each person sat on the floor facing sand mandalas representing the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. The mandala is made of limestone powder using a wooden mould. The wood has grooves cut in it in the shape of the mandala. The grooves are filled with limestone powder, and the mould is placed face down on the floor. A few taps on the wood makes the limestone powder fall on the floor, creating the mandala. As the priest chanted from sacred texts, they lighted butter lamps and placed flowers on the mandalas. The ritual concluded with a feast for all the relatives. Now my father was purified, and he could mix with other people and resume normal life. My father belonged to a thousand-year-old tradition of Lhasa Newar merchants. Going to Tibet and running the ancestral shop there was the karma of all the men in the family. They rotated between Kathmandu and Lhasa every so many years. The journey by mule caravan across high mountains and barren plains lasted almost a month. And every time one of the brothers returned from Tibet, he had to self-isolate and perform the rituals. The nee chwanegu system is said to go back to the Malla period, when the Tibet trade reached a peak. A fine evidence of those glory days is the community hall at Asan in central Kathmandu, which doubled as a holding centre for returning traders. The ceremonial square and vibrant bazaar straddles the trade route to Lhasa that traverses the Kathmandu Valley—one reason why it should come as no surprise that the Tuladhars, key players in the Tibet trade, have their ancestral homes here. Yita Chapa, the community hall, encloses the market square on the southern side. Oldsters recall that Tibet-returned merchants would self-isolate here for 15 days before re-entering their homes. There was a sunken water spout on the street leading into Asan, next to the city gate which only remains in oral history. The traders would bathe under its gushing water and make themselves presentable before stepping foot in the city.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/08/30/self-quarantine-kathmandu-style
77,Determinants in Indo-Nepal relations,"August 30, 2020","At this particular juncture, when Indo-Nepal relations are faced with unprecedented realities, it is important to factor in certain determinants in our analysis of the bilateral relations. These analysis-determinants can set the course of action that steer the future of our political and people-to-people links. Nepal emerged through major alterations to its political, social and cultural past, and became a republic and a federal and secular state. India’s crucial posture in orchestrating a 12-point agreement between the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the Seven-Party Alliance was one of the key features of the political settlement that ended a 10-year conflict. Nepal and India may have endorsed policies, agreements and treaties without really visualising the future impacts to their relations. In the future, policy consequences and exit strategies must be considered when determining the course of Indo-Nepal bilateralism. Rivalry and competition The China-United States power rivalry and China-India competition has and will continue to invite major political events in the Himalayan region. This rivalry and competition will also continue to invite strategic compulsions for nations in the region like Nepal that is at the centre of the Himalayan arc. Freshwater reservoirs, one of the largest in the world, will also be a factor for continued global interest in the region. Political actions and border disputes that appear will only lead to a trust deficit and reluctance and suspicion for cooperation between nations in the region including Indo-Nepal cooperation. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo remarked that the free world must change China or China will change the free world, indicating an open call for alignment against China’s expansionism. Speaking at a meeting of the US-India Business Council, Pompeo also reiterated the importance of India in the region. With this discourse in one corner, China’s growing interest in Nepal, the Belt and Road Initiative and other engagements appear equally appealing to the general eye, and more so to competitive national politics in Nepal. With 20 deals and over $500 million pledged in aid during President Xi’s visit to Nepal in 2019, China is fulfilling the right political needs in Nepal. The website of Nepal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows that China is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Nepal. Chinese investors committed to spend over $8.3 billion in Nepal during the Nepal Investment Summit concluded in Kathmandu in March 2017. China’s economic potent has and will continue to sway policy deliberation in countries including Nepal. The ongoing parliamentary discussion on the Millennium Challenge Corporation projects is an example of many geostrategic compulsions Nepal’s political powers may adhere to. Indo-Nepal agreements will likely be referenced to the necessity of peace and stability in Nepal and shared equity of trans-boundary resources. A handful of treaties and agreements guide and shape the Indo-Nepal special political relationship. The 1816 Sugauli Treaty between Nepal and the East India Company recognised the degree of sovereignty and integrity of Nepal. Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana’s goodwill to the East India Company during the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny was gesticulated by returning today’s Banke, Bardia, Kailali and Kanchanpur districts in the far western Tarai to Nepal.  The 1923 Nepal-Britain Treaty is also believed to be crucial in the history of Nepal for acknowledgement of Nepal’s independence and the right to conduct foreign policy. The 1947 British-India-Nepal Tripartite Agreement involving the three governments is a defence treaty allowing rights and continuation of Nepali citizens in both the British and Indian armies. This continues till today though equal benefits continue to be a contested argument. India’s independence and the fear of the spread of communism south of the Himalaya after China’s annexation of Tibet and the threat to the Rana regime created an environment for the signing of the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship. The 1950 treaty was the initiation of a new era and backbone of Indo-Nepal relations. After the promulgation of Nepal’s new constitution in 2015, the Eminent Persons’ Group on Nepal-India relations was formed in January 2016 with a mandate to review various aspects of bilateral relations including the 1950 Nepal-India Friendship Treaty in light of the changing regional and global context.  In the middle of 2020, members of the Eminent Persons’ Group stated that the group had completed its report in 2018, but still, it couldn’t be submitted to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as no time has been given as yet. It is reported widely that observers find it surprising that the group hasn’t been given time to submit its report even though the current prime ministers of Nepal and India—KP Oli and Narendra Modi respectively—had agreed to form it. Geo-strategic significance Moving forward, two principles will most likely be the guideline reference in Indo-Nepal relations. First, given the buffer zone characteristic of Nepal, the importance of peace and stability in Nepal for the reduced threat to neighbours cannot be ignored. Instability in Nepal may trigger a threat to peace and stability in the region and for Nepal’s neighbours. And second, trans-boundary resource benefits and costs should be equally shared between our two nations.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/08/30/determinants-in-indo-nepal-relations-1598769951
78,Covid-19 and human relationships,"August 29, 2020","The topic in question is discussed worldwide today because it evokes personal as well as impersonal modes of human relationships. The pandemic, very strangely and sometimes uncannily, juxtaposes the lonely helpless individual with the mighty power holders, money makers and ruthless administrators. Such juxtapositions take place in all spheres of life. To see how our own modes of personal relationships have been working in Nepal and South Asia, we have to see the conditions that influence our lifestyle, the attitudes of the rulers, methods of the political parties and the actions of wise people, sadhus, thugs, poets and musicians and painters. In this short essay, I want to present some pictures of human relationships I have studied about, experienced and seen working around me. This is a complex yet inviting subject to contemplate upon at this moment. Relationships grow in time. The energy needed for that comes from the great within. It rises as loneliness from inside and searches for a place in the great without. The process of relationships thereafter takes interpersonal and social courses to become a reality—a basis of existence. Much has been written about it. At such difficult times, however, we search for stable human relationships. But because of the closures, the precautions that we have to take, we are condemned to hide half of what we are. That affects relationships. The mask that one wears, metaphorically, eclipses half of the self. Each one of us has become half of what we were before this moment of crisis. As a literary writer, I value human relationships as the greatest source of strength. But never before had I realised that human relationships are also a search in the wilderness. I have discovered that more during these moments of a lockdown, when social meetings and networking opportunities are limited. I have always taken human relationships as a stable force, a source of creative interactions. On one occasion not long ago, I met a very dear person who I have worked with on a number of creative projects, shared experiences and helped academically. But hardly had I realised that the familiar mode of relationship with this person had changed. I found that there was nothing but emptiness, a tantalising indifference.  I was deeply shaken by this indifference, this strange metaphysics of relationships and, above all, this empty inner horizon. I heard similar stories from some of my close erstwhile students and writers who have become university teachers and writers. It dawned on me not long ago that this sunya, this indifference was the result of the Covid-19 situation that slowly drains trust, sense of meaning and relevance of human relationships. And I find that the greatest toll that the pandemic is taking is on the very power of human interactions. We will be condemned to deal with the half-ruined relationships and loss of a value-laden deal with one another. Some important literary and art works created in the world and in our own region have given portraits of calamitous times in the past. The modernist works show how an individual who is condemned to be lonely slides into one's own traps. They show how an individual, a small entity of humanity, is pitted against the big, powerful and gigantic outside. Covid-19 makes that clearer by showing how those who have power over individuals and boast about their power of management—even though that is mostly mismanagement—can easily influence the structure of human relationships. Their actions uncannily influence the nature of such connections in society. The capitalist economy, the surge of populism and the government, which promotes fragmenting society, dismantle the easy and working model made for the welfare of the people. In Nepal, our situation has always been complex; it’s been made worse by the Covid-19 situation. Individuals find that they are very badly affected by the chaotic management, the unfair open deals made by the government and the institutionalisation of corruption. The pandemic in Nepal presents some bizarre pictures. The loud and obvious relationship modes that can be seen on television and read online and in broadsheets are political in nature. The political in-fighting shows that the leaders are hastily creating and modifying relationships but not doing much towards dealing with the pandemic itself. The other kind of relationship is seen in deals whose subject is power and moneymaking. People watch such relationships justified in the name of the Covid-19 scourge. The other side of the coin is personal. We are reading reports about new problems that people have to be dealing with in individual relationships. That is another worrying subject. Reports about crashing relations and the serious lack of interest in maintaining human and warm connections make us sad and helpless. No degree of moral teaching can work at such times. The atmosphere of good relationships among people in the neighbourhood and society are crashing as a result of prejudices, selfishness and unfounded fears of contagion. Cooperation is the greatest mantra; much of that appears to be in short supply due to Covid-19.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/08/29/covid-19-and-human-relationships
79,External cooperation is essential to fight the pandemic,"August 29, 2020","Amid the onslaught of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, the global community today confronts untold human suffering and economic devastation. The World Health Organisation declared the pandemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres termed the situation the most serious global crisis since the Second World War and the greatest test being faced by the global community after the birth of the United Nations. The human loss has been disproportionately heavier in the developed world, including the United States and Europe. But in recent days, the number of reported infections and human deaths is rising exponentially in the developing world including South Asia. India has emerged as the third-largest victim, in terms of infections and casualties, after the US and Brazil, with 3.4 million infected cases and over 62,000 deaths. In Nepal, there are 35,523 cases, with 183 lives lost, as of the first half of August 28. The economic fallout from the pandemic has been even more serious. In the absence of a vaccine and efficacious treatment, preventive measures such as social and physical distancing, lockdowns and travel restrictions have been adopted by countries to contain the spread of the virus, leading to restrictions on the flow of goods and services, human movement and disruption of supply chains. This has resulted in reducing economic growth and driving millions to unemployment and poverty. The latest forecast by the World Bank envisions a 5.2 percent contraction of the global economy in 2020, the deepest recession in decades.  Advanced economies including the US, Europe and Japan are projected to shrink by 7 percent, with spillover effects across developing economies. The South Asian economy is projected to downgrade by 2.7 percent. The International Monetary Fund estimates Nepal's growth rate for the fiscal year 2019-20 to go down to around 1 percent (5 percent below the pre-pandemic baseline) from 7 percent in the last fiscal year. The adverse impact of the pandemic felt in industry, tourism, remittance inflows, transport, construction, agriculture, education and trade is well known. Compared to other South Asian neighbours like India and Bangladesh, Nepal has until now fared better. But the infection has been spreading fast in recent weeks.  The Covid-19 outbreak is obviously not a country-specific problem confined to national boundaries. We are living in an interdependent world with the need for cooperation with other countries, including with our neighbours India and China. Being a small country with resource constraints and a weak health care system, Nepal is not fully prepared to deal with the pandemic that has also troubled other countries in a big way. There is a need for regional and global cooperation to fight the coronavirus and its multifaceted impact. The Indian initiative in bringing the SAARC countries together through the video summit in April this year was a welcome development that broke the stalemate inside the regional grouping, whose summits have stalled since 2014. Such gestures need to be converted into concrete outcomes. With overlapping membership and proximity, the potential for cooperation also exists among the BIMSTEC member nations—forging links to ASEAN as well.  Cooperation can begin with the sharing of medical expertise and pharmaceutical competencies. It seems possible to explore collaboration on medicinal plants and herbs that boost immunity, based on indigenous knowledge and resources. There were reports of an Ayurvedic drug being invented by Patanjali Ayurved in India that could help the fight against the virus. A treatment was also being developed at the Institute of Forestry in Nepal based on the research of aromatic plants and herbs. But these efforts seem to have stalled in the absence of adequate interest and support by the relevant authorities to achieve potential success. Nor have there been adequate trials. In the current situation, the prevailing means to contain this highly infectious virus seems to be limited to social distancing measures, including lockdown and respiratory guidelines in the absence of proper treatment. Therefore, scientists and research teams across the world are making intensive efforts to develop vaccines to fight the virus and contain the spread of infection. In the global race for vaccine development, there are 165 vaccine candidates at different stages of development, of which 32 have reached the stage of large scale human trials. The vaccine being developed by the Jenner Institute at Oxford University is considered to be the front runner, with positive results in the preliminary trials. As vaccines require a long period for testing and further time for scale production, they are likely to be ready later this year and available for distribution only next year. Russia has claimed a breakthrough in the corona vaccine race with the approval of Sputnik V for full-scale production to start in September. But questions have been raised by scientists globally about its efficacy, calling the certification premature and inadequately vetted. Vaccine trials in the US are reportedly showing positive results, and the vaccine would be available between January and June 2021. Nepal's neighbours are also undertaking coronavirus vaccine trials for mass production. China's major pharmaceutical company Sinofarm plans to make vaccines commercially available by the end of this year. India is launching the first and second phase clinical trials for locally produced ZyCoV-D and Covazin vaccines. The Serum Institute of India, the manufacturing partner of Oxford-AstraZeneca, is conducting phase three trials of the Covidshield vaccine to be ready for deployment in December.  Against this backdrop, it is necessary for Nepal to explore cooperation with India, China and possibly others to ensure the timely availability of adequate vaccine supply. Increased health spending is required with better management of the healthcare system and improvement of facilities.  The present crisis calls for urgent actions to address, in addition to health sector problems, the economic consequences of the pandemic. Urgency is required to protect the vulnerable and implement reforms for a quick economic revival. The strategic priorities of our economic policy should be relief, recovery and sustainable growth. There has been general agreement on the policy imperatives with respect to relief, targeted fiscal stimulus, deferred tax payment and liquidity support for sectors facing disruption and liquidity shortage. Nepal has started benefitting with additional funding from development partners like the International Monetary Fund for debt relief and under the Rapid Credit Facility, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union and bilateral partners including Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Switzerland and South Korea to address fiscal and external financing needs. There is involvement of UN agencies in technical assistance. The felt need is improving the quality of governance, transparency and accountability, and addressing corruption problems in expenditure management at all levels.",Opinion,https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/08/29/external-cooperation-is-essential-to-fight-the-pandemic
80,Gold import down by 60 percent in last fiscal year,"September 5, 2020","Much like the import of other non-essential commodities the import of gold also declined sharply in the fiscal year 2019-20 with 60.6 percent less of it entering the country compared to the fiscal year 2018-19 mainly because of the fall in demand. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country imported Rs13.63 billion worth of the yellow metal in the last fiscal year, down from Rs34.63 billion compared to the previous one. The import had stood at Rs32.20 billion in the fiscal year 2017-18. Of the country’s total imports the share of gold was 1.1 percent in 2019-20.  Tej Ratna Shakya, former president of Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association said gold was imported only five months in the last fiscal year.  With price increasing from Rs60,000 to Rs70,000 per tola (11.66 gram) in mid-June 2019 there were no imports between mid-July to mid-October in 2019 due to a fall in demand, he said.  “But as people started getting used to the new price and demand increased steadily, import began in mid-October and went on until March. Then with the nationwide lockdown, imports came to a halt,” Shakya said.  While the price of gold per tola is hovering around the six-figure mark at present, prices have been on an upward trend since June last year, leading people to sell their gold which resulted in sales decreasing drastically.  Last year, the prices continued to rise in the international market mainly due to the trade conflict between the US and China and bullion traders found the precious yellow metal as a safe haven to invest. “The banks have not imported gold since the lockdown including in the current fiscal year,” he told the Post.  Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson of the central bank said that imports will reduce with the rise in price, reducing the demand in the domestic market and discourage buyers unless it is for occasions like a wedding when gold is generally required since it is considered a luxury item. “The pandemic has impacted the income and living standards of the people and they are focused on buying essentials rather than spending on luxury. Unless the economy gets back to normal, I don’t think the gold demand will rise,” Bhatta told the Post.  The dollar also became more expensive in the last fiscal year and this coupled with the continuous increase of bullion prices in the international market led to the decline in import.  “The decline in remittance is also an indirect reason for the fall in demand in the last fiscal year,” he added.  Lately, the price has reached previously unimaginable levels due to the economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic as investors around the world have poured their money into the precious metal with the fall in demand for oil and stock prices plunging. In Nepal, the price of the yellow metal reached six-figure at Rs101,400 per tola on August 5, breaking all the records for the first time and went up as high as Rs103,500 per tola, the highest record in the history of the bullion market, before slightly falling.  Similarly, the government raised the import duty on gold by Rs2,000 per gram to Rs8,500 in the budget for the fiscal year 2020-21. Its price has been fluctuating by $50 to 60 per ounce (28.34 gram) every day in the international market, according to Shakya.  But despite the rise in price, banks have been selling gold in substantial amounts after the lockdown was lifted on July 21. According to Anil Sharma, executive director of Nepal Bankers’ Association, after the lockdown was eased, 105 kg of gold was sold within a week.  “People might have purchased gold considering it as a safe haven for investment with a slowing down of the economy and seeing the continuous rise in price in the international market despite the hike in price,” he said. Commercial banks have 180 kg of gold in stock now. They are planning to import gold as soon as the restriction orders are lifted or eased as the available stock is getting low, Sharma told the Post.  Banks, who sell to gold dealers, used to import 600 to 650 kg of gold monthly before the lockdown, he said. While banks were allowed to import 20 kg of gold daily earlier, the government reduced the quota to 10 kg daily with foreign reserves dwindling.  According to Shakya, the domestic bullion market used to have transactions of nearly around Rs60 billion annually but now it has gone down by as much as Rs20-22 billion during the lockdown, he said. With the uncertain situation, he expects the bullion market will shrink for domestic use despite festivals like Dashain and Tihar as well as the wedding season approaching, Shakya added.  Bhatta said that around Rs30 billion has been saved from going outside while importing gold.",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/09/05/gold-import-down-by-60-percent-in-2019-20-as-price-had-been-going-up-since-june-last-year
81,New cyber security law requires firms to use information sharing platform,"September 4, 2020","The Nepal Telecommunications Authority has passed the Cyber Security Bylaw 2020 which aims to protect information and communication systems from cyber attacks and other associated risks. It requires telecommunication and internet service providers to make use of national and international cyber risk information sharing platforms to receive and share information regarding security issues, vulnerabilities and cyber threat intelligence.  The purpose of the platform is to establish a cyber security community in Nepal to facilitate the detection and prevention of cyber attacks by sharing cyber threat intelligence information. ATM heists resulting from compromised switching systems, distributed fund transfers into legitimate user accounts, and the hacking of the SWIFT system are the best known cases of data breaches in Nepal in the recent past.  These schemes were discovered and well publicised, but there are dozens of instances of card skimming, loss of personally identifiable and proprietary data and money laundering that were either resolved and unreported, or proceeding undetected, according to reports.  As digitisation grows in Nepal, it is inevitable that increasingly vast amounts of data across the public and private domains will also be at risk.  Nepal Telecommunications Authority Director Min Prasad Aryal said that with the rapid growth in information and communication technology, the number of criminal activities including cyber attacks has also gone up; and to overcome such potential risks, the new legislation contains provisions that service providers should follow.  “This includes establishing a cyber security community, a periodical audit of IT systems, and use of protection measures by complying with international standards,” Aryal told the Post. Security audit reports need to be submitted to the authority every six months. “Obviously, to make the system secure, service providers should invest in security. The higher the investment cost of technological infrastructure, the more secure the system will be,” he said.  Internet service providers say that updating technological infrastructures as per the bylaw will require resources and time amid the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. Since Nepal’s IT industry is small, immediate installation of technological infrastructure as envisaged in the new rule will take time, said Bhoj Raj Bhatta, president of the Internet Service Providers’ Association. “We have also asked for government support as upgrading the existing system may cost a lot of money.”  Advocate Baburam Aryal, who specialises in cyber law, said that service providers had been using systems based on their own internal policy as per the directives issued by the telecom regulator. In the absence of laws, many system securities are being ignored, and the new bylaw requires compliance, he told the Post.  “The new bylaw has been passed so that customer data does not get stolen, hacked or used for fraudulent activities and customer rights are protected with a secured system,” he said. According to the bylaw, service providers should map and analyse organisation communication and data flows for possible security threats. They should routinely assess their suppliers who supply equipment or third-party partners in the audit, and test the results to confirm they are meeting their contractual security obligations. For data security and privacy, service providers should apply encryption techniques for data transit. The firms should adopt data masking, anonymising techniques or encryption for customer data, and use hash/encryption to store sensitive data. Service providers should have a non-disclosure agreement with their employees, vendors or third parties to prevent copying, reproducing, distributing or selling of licensee’s digital data without the consent of the licensee. The customer’s digital data should not be shared with the vendor or any other third party without the consent of the customer— except to government law enforcement agencies like the police. Telecom and internet companies should have an updated copy of a document where all its technological assets like hardware, software and license are recorded, and segregated details as per usage, location, version, owner, purchaser and date are listed. The licensee should have the employee’s related policy addressing proper handling of social media, usage of official devices, personal devices and proper handling of official email/accounts and information. As per the bylaw, the organisation needs to change the password every 90 days. Service providers should act proactively as the first line of defence to protect their customers from known attacks. The firms should follow the common best security practices defined by—system administration networking and security, centre for internet security while using open source such as general public licence, Berkeley software distribution license for the operating system, applications, antivirus or anti-malware. Service providers should encourage using ‘pretty good privacy’ or digital signature in email communication, documents, letters and other applications. Similarly, service providers should have an internal security audit team for regular network, system, critical infrastructure audit.  Narayan Koirala, software engineer and managing director of Eminence Way, has worked on cyber security for more than a decade. He said that the new bylaw has incorporated the network, software, security, human resource security and monitoring part, which is laudable as it would enhance the security system. Similarly, enforcement of audit timing, security assessment timing, security operation centre, continuous monitoring, asset management and identification in the new legislation are good, he added. “The law, however, should be updated according to the time.” He said that the new rules would definitely have an impact on Nepal’s burgeoning IT industry at a time when service providers are not investing in upgrading their systems.

82,Airlines ignoring orders not to board passengers without negative PCR test report,"September 3, 2020","On August 25, a charter flight of Air Arabia landed at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport. Among the 161 passengers on board, 142 produced a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test report conducted in the last 72 hours as per regulations. But 18 passengers provided rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results, which have not been authorised by the Nepal government, and one passenger did not produce any test report at all. The Sharjah-based carrier arrived in Nepal in violation of the rules four days after the cabinet ordered that airlines should only board passengers with a negative PCR test report conducted in the last 72 hours. Airlines have also been barred from bringing passengers with and without PCR test reports on the same flight. A complaint was filed at the Civil Aviation Ministry as Air Arabia had violated the rule, and an investigation committee was formed. On Wednesday, the ministry ordered the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal to warn airlines not to make the same mistake again. Air Arabia was made to pay the hotel quarantine charges of the 142 passengers carrying negative PCR test reports as a penalty.  Again on August 28, nine of the 148 passengers arriving on a Silk Air flight from Singapore were found not to have a PCR test report. “As per government directives, we sent all the passengers to hotel quarantine. They will undergo PCR tests on Friday, and based on the test reports, they will be allowed to go to their respective destinations,” Nepal Army Spokesperson Brigadier General Santosh Ballav Paudel told the Post. The Nepal Army has been tasked with checking arriving passengers and taking them to holding centres before sending them to their destinations. “The airline will pay all costs as per the government decision,” he said.  The issue does not end here. On Wednesday, a Nepal Airlines flight from Japan landed in Kathmandu at 5:30 pm with 115 passengers on board. Among them, two had test reports but they were in Japanese while another passenger had brought an RDT report, according to Paudel.  One passenger who was attached to a diplomatic mission was released as its responsibility, and nine others were sent to home quarantine on humanitarian grounds as they have come to Nepal due to family problems, according to Nepal Airlines. “The rest were sent to hotel quarantine,” said Paudel. An unnamed airport official told the Post that tensions ran high on Wednesday evening when all passengers started to scold the passenger with the RDT report.  “The female passenger carrying the RDT report was stressed after being rebuked by her fellow passengers since they all had to stay in a hotel for more than a week,” the official said. “But actually it was the airline's mistake.” That mistake cost Nepal Airlines nearly Rs1.5 million in hotel and PCR test charges. On August 21, the cabinet decided that people coming to Nepal must produce an RT-PCR test report conducted in the last 72 hours, proof of advance hotel booking for seven days, and a barcode or print copy of the form they have to fill up by retrieving it from the website of the Covid Crisis Management Centre (ccmc.gov.np). The government has also restricted passengers with and without PCR test results from flying on the same flight.  Airlines breaking any rule and bringing people without PCR test results will have to bear all quarantine expenses of all passengers, according to the cabinet decision. Archana Khadka, spokesperson for Nepal Airlines Corporation, said that it was a mistake on their part and the airline will pay all costs. “We know about the government’s decision and we have circulated it to all airports that we fly to. It was a human error on the Japan flight.” An airport official said that Nepal Airlines had not appointed an airport manager at Narita International Airport in Japan and all responsibility had been entrusted to the local ground handling staff. “As a result, the problem appeared.” Khadka said PCR tests of the passengers would be conducted and other passengers released. But an official at the Civil Aviation Ministry told the Post that it was not possible as all passengers had to complete the mandatory hotel quarantine.  “There is no excuse at all.” The passengers have to spend at least seven days in the hotel after which their PCR tests will be conducted.  As airlines continued to flout the rule, Tribhuvan International Airport officials summoned all international airlines representatives on Thursday and warned them to abide by the government decision strictly, said Deo Chandra Lal Karna, spokesperson for the airport. “Violation of the rule has worried all employees and security officials at the airport.” Although Nepal has implemented a stringent rule to prevent the coronavirus from entering the country, some officials said that no mandatory provisions were set for departing passengers.  Recently, a charter flight from Sri Lanka landed in Kathmandu to pick up its stranded citizens. “There was confusion at the airport as to whether passengers entering the airport and flying out would require negative PCR test reports,” said an airport official. “It’s not compulsory in Sri Lanka, and the airline did not ask passengers to get tested before boarding the flight.”",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/09/03/airlines-ignoring-orders-not-to-board-passengers-without-negative-pcr-test-report
83,"With standards in place, online home delivery and takeaway services can resume","September 3, 2020","The Kathmandu District Administration Office has developed a standard for online home delivery and takeaway services of the restaurants and hotels which includes negative coronavirus infection tests for the delivery people. “Since the essential services would remain open till 11 am throughout Kathmandu Valley we have arranged for online delivery services from 1 pm to 7 pm,” said Janak Bhatta, who led a five-member study team to come up with recommendations to allow online deliveries.  According to Bhatta, other requirements include that the businesses for the online home delivery must be registered, all the details of the delivery people and their vehicles must be presented to the respective district administration offices, details of their customers—name, phone numbers and their proper address—must be presented if asked.  On August 30, the district administration office of Kathmandu had formed a five-member study team led by Assistant Chief District Officer Janak Bhatta with the representatives of the Health Ministry, Department of Commerce, Supplies and Consumer Protection Management, Nepal Police and Traffic Police.  With the new provision in place, hotels and restaurants can now sell their packed food products through home delivery. The online home delivery services were opened citing international practice and widespread criticism from different sections of the society, according to authorities. “Today we submitted our report to the chief district officer and he issued the standard right away,” said Bhatta. “As per the prohibition order extended on Wednesday, people in the online home delivery and take away businesses can now resume their services.” In the separate notices issued by all three chief district officers of the Kathmandu Valley on Wednesday, they had stated that online home delivery and take away services could be resumed once the standard was in place.  The quality and other protocols of the delivery service will be monitored by the Department of Commerce and the district administration offices regularly, with or without notice. On Wednesday and Thursday last week, the police rounded up several delivery people after Chief District Officer of Kathmandu Janak Raj Dahal said they were not allowed to operate when the prohibition orders were in place. Following the curb on their operations, the companies had urged him to allow their business as they were ready to follow all necessary health protocols.  But Dahal refused, saying that they did not have proper standards and monitoring mechanisms. The standard will also be implemented in Lalitpur and Bhaktapur districts with or without revisions.

84,Micro hydro plants destined for oblivion in rural Nepal,"September 2, 2020","A decade ago, when much of the country’s rural population lived off the grid, Nepali villages boasted their own renewable energy sources—micro hydro. They were all built by local communities. At that time, in 2010, only 65 percent of the population had an electricity connection. The micro hydro plants that typically produce 5 kW to 100 kW of electricity do not require a dam and reservoir like large hydroelectric plants. They had made life better for villagers, enabling children to study at night, and families to watch TV and use cell phones.  In Okhaldhunga, its four dozen micro hydro plants will soon become things of the past.  Locals had built a 12 kW plant on the Rumdi River in Manebhanjyang Rural Municipality-5 a decade ago which is still in operation. This year, they transferred the entire infrastructure to the Nepal Electricity Authority, which will use the electricity poles and transmission lines, but not the power produced by the micro hydro. Under the government’s electricity roadmap, the state-owned power utility is required to light up every household in Nepal by 2023. The Nepal Electricity Authority has signed power purchase agreements with the six hydropower projects being developed on the Solu River basin by the private sector which have a combined installed capacity of 217.5 megawatts. The project has been working to evacuate electricity through the Solu Corridor—a 132 kV transmission line connecting Tingla, Okhaldhunga, Jaljale and Lahan. The rural electrification project started in 2010 is jointly funded by the government and EXIM Bank of India, and is expected to be complete by December 2020. Man Bahadur Pulami, chairman of the Rumdi Khola Micro hydro Project, recounts that when they installed the micro hydro plant, the entire village was lit up and everyone was happy. Many locals even borrowed money to fund the hydro plant, and some invested their savings in it. The donor community and the village development committee also provided funding. The plant was constructed at a cost of more than Rs10 million. “Soon, the micro hydro will be of no use. The Nepal Electricity Authority did not allow us to use the plant as an alternative source of energy. However, the power utility will reuse the poles, transformer and wires,"" said Pulami. “Villagers have invested in the project, and now it’s going to waste as the village will soon be lit with power from the national grid. We are worried about the equipment as it will start to rust.” Not only in Manebhanjyang, many micro hydro plants built in the eastern hills will become useless sooner or later, according to locals. There are more than 50 micro hydro plants in Okhaldhunga that were built in the past one decade. These plants cost Rs1 billion to build, and can produce a combined 1 megawatt of electricity. Currently, 40 plants are operating. Several new projects had started operating in the last few years. “It looks like the investment of the community will now go to waste. It’s like pouring water on sand,” said Pradip Sunwar, a local at Khijidemba Rural Municipality. “The local people had contributed 90 percent of the labour while building such small projects that had transformed the village,” he added. “Everything is gone now.” Between 2007 and 2014, more than 400 micro run-of-the-river hydropower plants were built by the government with help from the World Bank as part of the Nepal Micro Hydro Promotion project. The smallest micro hydro plant, at 7 kilowatts, provides electricity to about 100 households; and the biggest one, at around 116 kilowatts, serves 940 households (about 4,023 people), according to the bank. “At least the government should have brought a policy to feed the power generated by these small micro projects into the national grid, and allow locals to invest in them and collect the returns,” said Sunwar. Sanjeev Kumar Sah, chief of the Nepal Electricity Authority’s distribution branch in Okhaldhunga, said work was in progress to assume ownership of all micro hydro projects including their infrastructure. “But there is no policy to buy or evacuate energy generated by these micro hydro plants to the national grid.” According to him, there was some discussion at a board meeting of the Nepal Electricity Authority. “But we haven’t heard of any decision.” As of now, the power utility has taken ownership of eight micro hydro plants. In Likhu Rural Municipality, the community, however, is not willing to hand over the project's ownership to the authority. Among the eight local units in Okhaldhunga, three—Siddhicharan Municipality, Chishanku Rural Municipality and Molung Rural Municipality—now get electricity from the national grid. Electric power had reached 94 percent of Nepal’s population as of 2018, according to the Energy Progress Report. Only 1.3 million out of the total population of 29 million remain to be connected to an electricity supply. In 2010, only 65 percent of the population had an electricity connection.",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/09/02/micro-hydro-plants-which-lighted-up-rural-nepal-destined-for-oblivion
85,Doubts raised over implementation of new market monitoring procedure,"September 1, 2020","Consumer rights activists and retailers have questioned the government’s capacity to implement the new market monitoring procedure recently unveiled by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies for public feedback. The Market Monitoring Procedure 2020, which came out earlier this week, is designed to protect consumers and will require businesses to follow certain quality standards.  “This is just to show that a process has been fulfilled as provisioned in the Consumer Protection Act and its regulations, but it may not be effectively implemented,” said Madhav Prasad Timilsina, president of the Consumer Rights Investigation Forum. “If the government had implemented the regulations effectively, there would be no need for this procedure.”  According to Sagar Mishra, director of the Department of Commerce, Supplies and Consumer Protection, the procedure has provisions that are not included in the Consumer Protection Act 2018. “Once the procedure comes into effect, it will make market regulation more manageable and effective,” said Mishra.  But consumer rights activists say they are not very hopeful about the new procedure, judging by the past performance of the department.  “People had high hopes that the passage of the Consumer Protection Act 2018 would make the market fair, competitive and consumer friendly,” Timilsina said. “But nothing like that has happened. Issues like the involvement of layers of middlemen in the vegetable trade continues.”  The Market Monitoring Procedure 2020 and the Market Monitoring Regulation 2020 have been approved by the Central Marketing Monitoring Committee, which is chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies and consists of representatives from various ministries and departments. The committee is currently seeking feedback from stakeholders. The document will be sent to the cabinet for approval, and its implementation will be proclaimed through the Nepal Gazette. According to Mishra, market inspection is currently being conducted on the basis of the Joint Market Inspection Procedure 2010. The new regulation will require mandatory quality checks and Nepal Standard certification for goods. The packaging label should also clearly mention what is inside the package, its quantity and the symbol number of the product that the department has given. Failure to adhere to these rules could lead to a jail term of three months to five years, and a fine ranging from Rs50,000 to Rs600,000.  Inspection teams can shut down a firm for violating the law, and it will be allowed to resume operations only after a re-inspection. A company that has been charged with flouting regulations can apply for a retest by providing a sealed sample of the product in question for laboratory verification.  Traders may be fined on the spot, and this may be communicated through telephone, fax or other electronic media, or through letters.  The rule also empowers the inspection chief to take the accused into custody if he or she tries to escape, destroy evidence or obstruct the investigation process. The department is short staffed with only 20 market inspectors, and they rarely venture out of the Kathmandu Valley.  The department had recently asked the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies for another 20 inspectors, but its request was turned down.  “So there is no possibility of appointing new manpower immediately,” said Netra Prasad Subedi, director general at the department. But he added that the new procedure empowers provincial and local governments.  “Provincial and local governments and district administrations can also be given the authority to conduct market inspection,” said Subedi. “We have already written to the 77 district administrations in this regard.”  Although Subedi claims the new procedure and regulations will make the monitoring system more systematic and limited, consumer rights activist Timilsina has his doubts.  “If the rules were not being implemented according to the Act, there is no hope for the implementation of the procedure and regulation either,” Timilsina said. “The issue of maintaining quality in consumer items has been talked about for 10 years, but it has not happened yet.”  Officials may conduct raids on businesses, but they must be accompanied by the police and local representatives or residents, according to the new procedures. If any member of the inspection team has a conflict of interest, he or she should inform the supervising officer in advance. The Central Market Monitoring Committee has endorsed the Market Monitoring Procedure 2020, and it has been made public for feedback and suggestion, Subedi said.  Traders are also sceptical about the new procedures being effective.  “While conducting market inspection, there is lack of coordination between different government agencies; and as a result, officials get confused and the outcome is not as effective as expected,” said Raj Kumar Shrestha, president of the Nepal Retailers Association.

86,"With economy hit by Covid-19, sales of motorcycles and cars down by up to 50 percent, dealers say","August 31, 2020","In 2014, Bikash Oli bought his first motorcycle—a Bajaj Pulsar 150. For Oli, then an undergraduate student, the motorcycle became his primary mode of transportation. When Oli graduated in 2017 and started working, he also began saving so that he could upgrade his motorcycle. “I have always enjoyed off-road riding, and I wanted my next motorcycle to be something that could handle off-road terrains,” said Oli. By early 2020, Oli had saved enough and had zeroed in on a few models. “On top of the list was Hero Xpulse 200. The motorcycle was well within my budget and it seemed like a decent off-roader, too,” said Oli. “Having saved enough, my plan was to buy a new one this year.”  In March, which is when automobile dealers start announcing their Nepali New Year offers, Nepal went into lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. When the lockdown protracted for months and the economy took a hit, Oli's salary was significantly deducted.  “I realised that buying a new motorcycle in the uncertain economic climate wasn’t a wise decision,” said Oli. During the first nation-wide lockdown, 90 percent of economic activities in the country came to a halt. Businesses, big and small, are struggling; thousands of jobs have been lost, and pay cuts have become the norm across industries. In a country where automobiles are generally expensive, Covid-19’s impact on the economy and the lockdowns have caused automobile sales figures to hit record lows.  And with infections on a steep rise, industry stakeholders aren’t very optimistic about the foreseeable future.  “The nationwide lockdown was announced at the peak sales time,” said Ramesh Danekhu, marketing communications manager at Morang Auto Works, the authorised distributor of Yamaha two-wheelers in Nepal.  After Dashain and Tihar, sales of vehicles are normally high during the Nepali New Year in mid-April.  Yamaha, according to Dhaneku, makes 20 percent of their annual sales during the Nepali New Year period. “But this year, due to the lockdown we had zero sales,” said Danekhu.  After the lockdown was lifted on July 21, industry executives said they were hopeful that things would get better. Accordingly, they started launching schemes and discounts offers.  Yamaha offered two-wheelers on zero down payment and zero percent finance; HH Bajaj, the authorised distributors of Bajaj two-wheelers in Nepal, offered discounts for customers purchasing motorcycles in cash, zero percent interest for customers willing to pay 50 percent down payment; Jagdamba Motors, the authorised distributors of TVS motorcycles in Nepal, offered zero percent interest rates and a long term EMI. The schemes and offers did help in garnering interest. “When the lockdown was lifted, our showrooms saw a lot of footfalls. There were a lot of enquiries,” said Danekhu.  “Sales figures too were encouraging.” Danekhu said Yamaha even managed to meet its Shrawan month’s [mid-July to mid-August 15] target. TVS and Bajaj said they did decent business. “After months of zero-sales, the business after the lockdown was a huge boost to us,” said Punam Singh, assistant general manager-marketing at HH Bajaj.  Apart from the schemes and offers, there were several factors that led to the surge in demand post-lockdown, say auto executives.  “The four-month-long lockdown created pent-up demand. When showrooms finally opened, people flocked to buy motorcycles,” said Deepak Agrawal, vice president of Jagdamba Motors. “There was also a segment of buyers who bought motorcycles because Covid-19 has made travelling in public transportations risky.” With the odd-even rule for vehicles, there were four wheeler owners buying two wheelers as an alternative mode of transportation, said Agrawal.  But the segment of buyers that was largely missing, say auto executives, were those purchasing a second motorcycle or upgrading to a new one.  “The economic uncertainty has made people very conscious about spending. Another reason people don’t want to spend their savings is because they are largely worried for medical care,” said Singh. According to the import data of Trade and Export Promotion Centre, Nepal imported two-wheelers worth Rs18.76 billion in the 2019-20 fiscal year, a decline of 18.11 percent compared to the 2018-19 fiscal year when the figure stood at Rs22.91 billion.  There has been a gradual increase in the import of motorcycles in the past few years with the import bill of Rs15.37 billion in the fiscal year 2015-16, Rs20 billion in the fiscal year 2016-17, and Rs21.74 billion in the fiscal year 2017-18.  While two-wheelers recorded encouraging sales when the lockdown was lifted, the same wasn’t the case for four-wheelers. Unlike two-wheelers, buying a four-wheeler—the least expensive of which cost two million rupees—in Nepal is a high-value investment.  To woo customers in these difficult times, four-wheeler brands did come up with offers and schemes. Laxmi Intercontinental, the authorised distributors of Hyundai cars in Nepal, offered cash discounts on certain Hyundai models and service vouchers to medical workers. “When we reopened in July we adopted stringent safety measures at all our showrooms and service centres too and even offered online booking options for our customers,” said Rupesh Sharma Bhatta, general manager of Laxmi Intercontinental, the authorised distributor of Hyundai cars in Nepal .  But that did not help much.  At Hyundai, overall sales have been down this year by as much 40 to 50 percent compared to last year and in the month between the time the lockdown was lifted on July 21 and and prohibitory orders came into place on August 19, sales have been down 30 percent, according to Bhatta.  Many customers who had booked cars before the nation-wide lockdown, say auto executives, have also decided to postpone purchases for now. “Given that a lot has changed in the past few months, some customers who have booked cars with us have opted to wait for the time being,” said Bhatta.  The story is similar in the case of Maruti Suzuki cars, the other popular brand. “When the first phase lockdown got over, we did see an encouraging number of enquiries, but those enquiries didn’t really convert into sales,” Karan Shakya, senior manager-marketing at CG Motocorp, the authorised distributor of Maruti Suzuki cars in Nepal. “It didn’t help that since November 2018, Nepal Rastra Bank directive only allows banks and financial institutions to only provide up to 50 percent as loan against the actual valuation of vehicles, which means customers have to pay 50 percent down payment.” Sales have declined by nearly 50 percent compared to last year’s business during the same period, said Shakya.  According to the data of Trade and Export Promotion Centre, the country imported cars, jeeps and vans worth Rs12.91 billion in the fiscal year 2019-20, a sharp decline of 26.56 percent compared to the fiscal year 2018-19 when the import figure stood at Rs17.58 billion.  Similarly, the country imported cars, jeeps and vans worth Rs12.94 billion in 2015-16, Rs16.83 billion 2016-17 and Rs17.97 billion in the fiscal year 2017-18.  The Trade and Export Promotion Centre figures do not include customs duty. According to the integrated custom rate 2019-20 of the Department of Customs, the customs duty for two wheelers varies between 105.66 percent to 135.04 percent while that for four-wheelers is between 225.44 percent to 306.8 percent depending on the cylinder capacity.  According to Krishna Prasad Dulal, president of Nepal Automobile Dealers’ Association, overall vehicle import has plunged by 50 percent compared to the same period last year.  “Be it two-wheeler or four-wheelers, the whole industry has suffered huge losses, and until and unless life doesn’t go back to normalcy, the industry will continue to incur losses,” said Dulal.  With cases of the coronavirus rising and uncertainty over how long the prohibitory orders in different parts of the country will continue, automobile dealers are worried because Dashain and Tihar are nearing.  “The months from September to November are the most important months for automobile companies in Nepal. This window is when our company makes 40 percent of its annual sale,” said Shakya of CG Motocorp.  It’s best not to have any hope for this year, says Dulal. “Given how the Covid-19 situation is in the country, it’s best the automobile industry forgets this year,” said Dulal. ""All we can do is hope that by next year, some semblance will return and we can all focus on getting our businesses back on track.""",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/08/31/with-economy-hit-sales-of-motorcycles-and-cars-down-by-up-to-50-percent-dealers-say
87,International nonprofits struggle to meet target to divert funds to fight Covid-19,"August 31, 2020","Although the Social Welfare Council urged international non-governmental organisations to divert 20 percent of the amount mentioned in their existing project agreements to fight Covid-19, most of the organisations have not responded to the call yet. Only 50 international NGOs have so far received approval from the Social Welfare Council to divert Rs 948.26 billion from their funds for programmes aimed at preventing and controlling the spread of Covid-19. Three international NGOs have applied for permission to divert Rs 220.25 million from their existing funds to fight Covid, while five have brought in fresh funds to fight the pandemic. The council had made the call as the government faces a resources crunch in its fight against the pandemic. “The number of foreign NGOs that have diverted funds to fight Covid-19 has been below our expectations,” said Durga Prasad Bhattarai, information officer at the council. “We had expected almost all of the 210 active foreign NGOs to present proposals to divert their funds to fight Covid-19.” The amount of money diverted towards the fight against Covid-19 is less than the 20 percent target set by the council for this fiscal.  International non-governmental organisations pledged aid worth Rs 21.62 billion for 2020-21, according to the State of Technical Assistance and Other Assistance published by the Ministry of Finance. In the last fiscal year 2019-20, the foreign NGOs had pledged Rs 24.79 billion, according to the ministry. Before the council asked the foreign NGOs to divert the fund, the Association of International NGOs, a grouping of foreign NGOs in the country, had requested the council in late March to approve in principle the diversion of up to 100 percent of their programme budget for the next four to six months to work on Covid-19 preparedness and response programmes according to the priority set by the government. But, the NGOs have struggled to meet even the 20 percent target set by the council. According to Bhattarai, foreign NGOs face a host of challenges in diverting their funds for Covid-related programmes. “One of the reasons is that they are not getting approval from their donors,” said Popular Gentle Bhusal, country director at IPAS Nepal, an international NGOs working in the field of reproductive health. He shared his own experience, “It took me a lot of time to convince our donors as they were reluctant to approve the diversion of funds originally approved for a particular programme,” said Bhusal, also a member of association of international NGOs.  But eventually, IPAS Nepal received approval from the council to divert Rs 12.5 million for the prevention and control of the Covid 19 after its proposal was endorsed by its donors. It will now use the funds to distribute health kits to all provincial and federal hospitals. Similar is the experience of Govinda Adhikari, former country director at IM Swedish Development Partners. “After the donor— Swedish International Development Agency, refused to approve the diversion, we received a separate fund from the headquarters of IM Swedish Development Partners,” he said. According to Adhikari, his organisation has spent over Rs 3 million on Covid-19 programmes.  Representatives from international NGOs say that the government also needs to request institutional donors, at least those who have residencial offices in Nepal, to adopt a flexible stance on diversion of funds to fight Covid-19.  Many international NGOs receive funds from the donor agencies which have residential offices in Nepal even though the government’s policy says such donors shouldn’t provide aid earmarked for Nepal foreign NGOs.",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/08/31/international-nonprofits-struggle-to-meet-target-to-divert-funds-to-fight-covid-19-1598856041

It is the first time that the tax authority authorised domestic printing presses to print the excise duty stickers in more than two decades. In the late 1990s too it had printed stickers for the tax authority. But, in order to ensure high security features, the department has been getting supply of stickers from abroad ever since. “We have ordered printing 96.9 million pieces of excise duty stickers to Janak Education Material Centre,” said Gajendra Thakur, deputy director general at the department. “We have ordered printing three types of stickers for cigarettes and chewing tobacco.” He said that the state owned printing body is expected to start supplying the printed stickers in one and half months. The department is spending around Rs110 million to get these stickers printed from Janak Education Material Centre.  Tax officials were forced to seek alternatives after Perusahaan Umum Percetakan Uang Republik Indonesia (Perum Peruri), selected to supply the stickers in March, didn’t show up to sign a contract with the department.  The centre usually prints text books for government schools. It had also printed ballot papers for the federal, provincial and local elections in 2017.  The tax authority was forced to print the stickers at domestic printing presses as an emergency measure given that it is running out of stickers for liquors and tobacco one by one but it takes several months to procure the stickers calling a fresh international tender. As per the law, such stickers must be pasted to sell the liquor and tobacco products in the market. But, the tax authority said it is now running out of 4 or 5 types of stickers for tobacco and liquor. “There are no stickers for the imported liquors. We also don’t have 2 or 3 types of stickers for cigarettes,” said Shivadevi Dahal, another deputy director-general at the department. “We will soon run out of stickers for gutkha (chewing tobacco) too.” An official at the Janak Education Material Centre said that the printing body has been making preparations to print the stickers. “We signed an agreement with the supplier of the papers for the stickers on Friday last week,” said Chitra Acharya, spokesperson at the Janak Education Material Centre. “We have also called tender for some small machines required to print the stickers.” According to the centre, it aims to print the sticker with an acceptable level of security features based on whatever equipment and materials it has available. “We cannot ensure all the security features that existed with the stickers printed abroad,” said Acharya. Although the tax authority had also planned to get the stickers printed from the Department of Printing too the printing department could not ensure the minimum security features for the excise stickers, according to Thakur. “The printing department also showed no interest to procure required machines to print the stickers and we are getting the stickers printed only from Janak,” he said.  Had the tax authority not faced a legal challenge for its bidding process in late 2019, it would have got the supply of stickers by now, according to officials at the tax authority. Its procurement process was delayed after the Supreme Court in November issued a stay order on the deal in response to a writ petition arguing that the domestic printers were not allowed to take part in the bidding process.  But on February 24, this year, the court allowed the tax authority to resuscitate plans to buy such stickers by vacating the earlier interim order, giving a sigh of relief to the officials of the tax authority.  After the clearance from the court, the Perum Peruri, the lowest evaluated bidder, was selected to print and supply stickers and invited for signing the contract. But, the Indonesian company refused to come to sign the contract. Although the department could have awarded the contract to the second lowest bidder, a Lithuanian company, the department refused to do so, citing some technical issues. The Lithunian company then moved the Supreme Court citing section 27(6) of the Public Procurement Act, which says contracts should be awarded to the second-ranked bidder if the first-ranked bidder refuses to sign the deal. This created further problems for the department to issue a fresh tender. Although the Supreme Court didn’t issue an interim order as sought by the Lithuanian company, the case is still pending. So, officials at the tax authority said they could not call fresh international tender too as long as a court case is pending.",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/08/30/government-printing-press-to-print-nearly-100-million-pieces-of-excise-stickers
89,Livelihood of hundreds of fish farmers in Province-5 at stake,"August 29, 2020","Tara Pandey, who has been engaged in fishing for 19 years at Siyari-5, Siddhapur in Rupandehi, had to bear losses for the first time since she started working as a fish farmer. She has not been able to sell fish after mid-March assuredly. Fish have been dying in the pond, and the ones that are alive, she has not been able to take them to the market. ""The market should have been opened by finding alternatives,"" she said, who started her fishery under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernization Programme in the fiscal year 2015-16. She says she used to sell up to 4 quintals of fish daily earlier, with her produce tapping into markets in Syangja, Pokhara, Parasi, even till Sunauli in India. Now her sales have dwindled to be just around 70 kg a day.  Sales used to be so good that until last year, she was earning up to Rs150,000 a month, she says. But now, she is struggling to pay the salaries of her nine employees. She has not even been able to afford fuel expenses to take her fish to the market, she says. If the situation persists, and the nation continues to be under lockdown, farmers whose livelihoods depend on fish farming in Province-5 are heading for more difficult days.  Like Pandey, Din Bahadur GC, of Pyuthan Municipality of Pyuthan, too, said that this was the first time he had faced a problem in the fish business. GC, who started rearing fish from 2005 by making a pond in eight ropanies of land, said that 155 kg of his fish have died during the lockdown. ""My pond is about to empty now, because my fish are dying and I have not been able to bring young fish,"" he said.  Bindulal Shrestha, central senior vice president of the Fishermen Traders Association, said that because of rising temperature, the fish in the pond are being deprived of oxygen and are thus dying. “Additionally, farmers have not been able to give them enough feed,"" he said, adding that purchasing feed too has become a problem. Earlier, before the lockdown, feed traders used to provide feed to farmers in credit but now—because of the economic uncertainty brought in by the pandemic—they demand cash. This additional cost for farmers, who are already under financial stress, is having an impact on their fish. Shrestha said that the cost for fish farmers has increased doubly because they are feeding fish that are ready for the market.  Another problem is that feed in warehouses is fast running out and there is a shortage of raw material required for the feed, he added. Because of this shortage, GC says he has been rearing his fish by making feed at home and has not purchased feed from the market after lockdown. ""The farmers will suffer if the same situation persists,"" he said. In Bardiya too the problem is the same. Farmers are dependent on Rupandehi, Kailali and Bake districts for fish and feed, but with travel restrictions imposed farmers are in trouble. Despite earning a good income from fish farming for years, farmers said that the fear caused by Covid-19 has led to a sharp decline in this year's income. According to farmers, they used to earn up to Rs 20,000 daily from fish all year round. This year, things are uncertain. Farmers say that fish farming has been supporting their household expenditures but as business has come to a standstill they are having to bear losses.  However, Tulsiram Bhandari, chief of Province-5, said, ""Fishermen have not complained about the impact of the lockdown yet. But if the lockdown is extended, alternatives need to be found."" There has been no discussion about that right now, he added. According to the Directorate of Livestock and Fisheries Development, fishing is being done across 3,166 hectares in the province, of which 2,805 are artificial reservoirs and 361 are natural reservoirs. The fish farming in the artificial reservoir produces 13,355 metric tonnes of fish annually. Similarly, a total of 626 metric tonnes of fish is produced in the natural reservoirs. There are 1,625 commercial fish farmers in the state and 1,315 registered fish farm firms in operation. Silver, Rahu, Naini, Brigade, Grass and common fish are bred in the fish ponds of the state.",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/08/29/livelihood-of-hundreds-of-fish-farmers-in-province-5-at-stake
90,Central bank to provide Rs 112 billion refinance facility to sectors hit hard by Covid-19,"August 29, 2020","Commercial banks across the country have started to take in applications from borrowers to deliver them refinance facilities. The refinance facility has been introduced by the central bank to assist businesses affected by Covid-19 under the provision made in the monetary policy for the current fiscal year 2020-21. The facility subsidises the interest rate for borrowers and is to be available for six months, with an option of extension of six months.  As per the policy, exports and sick industries as well as other sectors will get special refinancing facilities at a maximum 3 percent interest rate, while micro, cottage and small industries will get credit at a maximum 5 percent interest rate. After the central bank called applications on August 17, with a deadline of one and half months, commercial banks have started to collect applications from their borrowers.  As per the central bank notice, the sectors that have been worst affected and the sectors which have faced middle-level impact can apply for the facility. As per the monetary policy, the central bank has promised to provide 70 percent of refinance support by collecting applications collectively from the borrowers. Under this facility, refinancing of up to Rs50 million will be available for each customer. For bigger projects, such as hydropower projects, the central bank has made the provision of providing 20 percent of total refinance amount. A borrower can get up to Rs200 million under this window. The amount is expected to differ on a case to case basis. To microfinance institutions, the central bank will channelise 10 percent of the total refinance fund. “Under the first window, a fund of around Rs112 billion will be available for refinancing,” said Dev Kumar Dhakal, chief of the regulations department at the central bank.  However, as local authorities across the country have continued to maintain prohibitory orders amid Covid-19 risks, a majority of banks are providing services by operating limited branches with a limited number of employees.  A total of 110 branches out of 240 branches have remained closed, according to the state-owned bank. “Our branches across the country are collecting the applications. But we have so far received few applications, as nearly half of the branches are closed,” said Kiran Kumar Shrestha, chief executive officer at the Rastriya Banijya Bank, a government-owned bank.  Shrestha says that once prohibitory orders are eased, the bank will receive a large number of applications, as many businesses have been badly affected by the pandemic.  Similarly, the Himalayan Bank has also started collecting the applications. “We have been receiving applications from across the country, but I am not sure how many applications have been received,” he said. He said that the applications would be processed according to first come first serve basis. Some other banks have also issued a notice asking borrowers to apply for the facility. For example, Sanima Bank on Friday issued a notice asking its borrowers to submit applications by September 15. Likewise, Siddhartha Bank, in a notice on Friday, has sought applications from its borrowers by September 13.  As per the central bank’s notice, the tourism sector, including travel, hospitality and aviation sector, movies and theatres, poultry, livestock, fishery, handicrafts and readymade garment, among others, are the most affected sectors. Likewise, the sectors which faced middle-level impact—such as schools, transportation services, beauty parlours, legal and engineering firms, construction industry, pharmaceutical industries, fitness centres, media houses and hydropower projects others—will also get the refinance facility. In order to provide the subsidised loans, the central bank will make available resources to commercial banks at low (at 1,2 and 3 percent) interest rates.  As the country went under complete lockdown for nearly four months, these sectors were massively affected. Now, as local governments have implemented prohibitory orders, these sectors are expected to suffer more.",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/08/29/in-first-phase-central-bank-to-provide-rs-112-billion-refinance-facility-to-sectors-hit-hard-by-covid-19
91,Customers bewildered after police stop online stores from making deliveries,"August 28, 2020","Anil Panta was hoping that the groceries he had ordered from an online store on Monday would arrive by Friday as he watched his supply of rice, lentils and oil getting smaller and smaller. If they are not delivered to his home, he has no idea how he is going to bring them as motorcycles are not allowed to operate. Customers like Panta are bewildered after the police ordered online stores to stop making deliveries, saying that they were violating lockdown restrictions. “I ordered Rs7,000 worth of daily essentials from Thulo.com, and I paid for them online,” he said. The 35-year-old resident of Dhobi Khola, Chabahil recently lost his job in an automobile company. “I do not have enough cash, and it will take time to get a refund. I do not know how I am going to get groceries now,” he said. Senior Superintendent of Police Shyam Gyawali of the Metropolitan Police Office, Kathmandu said that the e-commerce entrepreneurs and delivery personnel that the police had detained on Thursday were released on the condition they would stop making deliveries. The District Administration Office shut down hotels and restaurants from Wednesday. It said essential businesses like pharmacies and drinking water would be allowed to operate. Shops selling milk and dairy products, fruits and vegetables and meat products will be allowed to open till 9:15 am. Gyawali said that online stores could also deliver essential goods till that time. “Since there is no mechanism to implement health protocol among the home delivery people we have not allowed them to function. It possesses a serious threat to people as thousands of these people reach different houses in the city,"" said Janak Raj Dahal, chief district officer of Kathmandu.  The District Administration Office had previously permitted online sellers to operate delivery services from August 20 after restriction orders went into effect from midnight of August 19.  Consumer rights activists said that banning the delivery of essential goods amid a pandemic was deplorable. ""This is the result of lack of coordination between government authorities. This type of action by the police administration could create a terrible situation,"" said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. ""Officials of the three District Administrative Offices in the Kathmandu Valley have said that they will not stop transportation of essential goods. It is the weakness of the government to take action against those that have been making home deliveries in the middle of a pandemic,” he told the Post.  But the government has safety as its biggest concern. ""These services would only be necessary if the prohibition order were to go for a long time but essential services could open every morning” Dahal told the Post. “""The Commerce Department said that they can be allowed strictly following health protocols but the Health Ministry called for a complete halt.” E-commerce entrepreneurs bear losses running into thousands of rupees when perishable goods are not being delivered on time and they have to cancel the order and refund the money.  Surakchya Adhikari, co-founder and chief operating officer at Thulo.com, suffered a loss of Rs80,000 because fruits and vegetables could not be delivered on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. “With the restriction order, the number of orders and volume has increased in recent days. Considering the restriction period, a single customer was placing orders for grocery items and vegetables and fruits worth more than Rs10,000-15,000,” she told the Post. E-retailers are of the view that rather taking decisions haphazardly without any discussion with stakeholders, it would be a relief if the government provided them time so that they do not have to bear losses. “It is impacting us psychologically. We have payments to make to our staff who are working during these hard times, and we have office rent, payments to our suppliers and other operational charges. Every day we have to wake up with uncertainty and fear what will happen,” Adhikari said. Anil; Basnet of Metrotarkari added that the government should have notified us earlier instead of holding the delivery staff on the road and picking up entrepreneurs from their working place as this does not deliver a good message in society, and entrepreneurs will feel that they have attempted to commit a crime. “The home delivery service might never be a government priority as it is more focused on creating crowds at grocery stores in the morning rather than safely delivering essentials at home,” he added. E-commerce is being prioritised by many countries at the time of the pandemic and funding them, but the government here is discouraging, said e-retailers. “It seems like our current government does not have any vision at all. There is extreme mismanagement and lack of coordination between government entities,” said Kavi Raj Joshi, founder and managing director of Next Venture Corp. If someone has made a mistake or gone against the rules, the government should have warned them once, not detained them, he said. It will make entrepreneurs feel they have done a crime by providing service to the nation in this situation, he added. “How can we imagine foreign entities coming to Nepal and invest?” he said. This will leave a negative impact on upcoming entrepreneurs, Joshi added. “Other nations are setting up innovation funds at the time of the pandemic, they are asking for business models from us to fight Covid-19, funding is being made for e-commerce and logistics by the government so that crowds can be lessened,” he said. While Yuba Raj Khatiwada, spokesperson for the government, was saying that digital payment was picking up well in the country in the last four months, and announced that a new E-Commerce Act was being promulgated for e-commerce at a press briefing on Thursday, on the other side of town e-commerce entrepreneurs were being detained. The government needs to clearly mention what is allowed and what is not in advance so that the entrepreneurs do not have any confusion, he said.  The pandemic has hit the nation for more than five months, but the government has not been able to come up with an operational strategy for e-commerce and address the problem for delivering essential goods.  Sagar Dev Bhatta, co-founder of Mero Kirana, said that a group of e-commerce entrepreneurs held a meeting with officials of the District Administration Office, Kathmandu on Friday and submitted a letter to allow e-retailers to deliver essential goods.. The government said that shops selling essential food items would be allowed to open till 9:15 am and closed our services. “We were gaining the trust of people, but this action has made us look bad for not delivering the goods,” he added.  ""We could allow delivery services to operate only after a protocol is prepared and a mechanism is set up to monitor them,"" Dahal said. “But right now we don’t have one.”  That means people like Panta will have to go to a grocery store every day and that is risky too.

92,Farmers get raw deal as middlemen take the lion's share,"August 27, 2020","Pema Yolmo of Ramphok village in the eastern hill district of Ilam collected a bumper ginger harvest earlier this year. He took home 3.2 tonnes of the root, which is prized as a spice, and was expecting to have a good year. But things didn't happen as Pema had thought. He was paid much less for his crop than he had expected. He had to sell his ginger for Rs50 per kg to Nepali middlemen acting for Indian traders who would ship the products to India. Apparently, Pema didn't know that ginger fetches Rs100 per kg in Birtamod, the trade hub in the plains for farm produce from the eastern hills. By the time the ginger crosses the border into India, the price would have risen to Rs160 per kg—more than three times what Pema was paid. Farm produce pass through at least two layers of middlemen before they reach the actual exporter, according to a number of traders the Post talked to. In Ramphok and many other places in Ilam, the prices are set by a small cartel of middlemen since farmers can’t take their crops to market due to lack of access.  “We could get a good rate if we could take our produce to market ourselves,” Pema says, “but the middlemen won’t let us do that, and there’s no designated market to sell our crops on a large scale.” For years, farmers like Pema have been selling their produce ranging from ginger, cardamom and broom grass to tea through brokers. As a result, they get a raw deal, Pema said. Indian middlemen hold a monopoly on purchasing crops from farmers in the eastern hill districts. Growers allege that local government officials work in cahoots with these middlemen.  “They fix a rate that is favourable to them rather than the farmers,” said Pema. “The Indian traders run a syndicate, we can’t do anything.” Tea and large cardamom farmers face the same problem. According to Yam Bahadur Subedi who grows large cardamom on his 40-ropani farm, he barely breaks even. One of the main reasons why farmers are forced to take whatever they can get is obstacles to exporting Nepali agro products to India. Indian states have been increasingly hostile to Nepali imports, say Nepali farmers and businessmen.  In the early days of the pandemic, the Indian state of West Bengal had stopped the import of Nepali agro products for a few days. But the pandemic was merely an excuse, say traders.  Shanta Chhetri, a Rajya Sabha member representing Darjeeling, had asked the Indian Upper House to ban the import of Nepali tea, claiming that it was of a low quality and not fit for consumption. This was not the first that there had been objections to the import of Nepali tea in the Indian market. Earlier, an association of tea producers from Darjeeling had presented a letter of demand to the then president of India Pranab Mukharjee to bar entry to Nepali tea. Institutional hostility is coupled with the spread of insidious misinformation about the quality of Nepali tea, according to Suresh Mittal, president of the Nepal Tea Producers’ Association, Jhapa.  “Nepali tea has been tested in India’s central food lab,” he said. “Our tea is not of poor quality. Actually, it is Indian tea that is often proven to be toxic; but Indian tea entrepreneurs have been spreading misinformation about the quality of Nepali tea.” Moreover, some Indian traders have been falsely branding Nepali tea as a product of Darjeeling and exporting it to third countries, according to Mittal. Uday Chapagain, operator of Ilam-based Gorkha Tea Estate, agrees with Mittal. “Nepali tea in general is of a far superior quality than Indian tea,” he told the Post. “Incidents where entrepreneurs from across the border are falsely branding our tea as their own have malicious motives.” The whim of border officials and bribes influence tea exports to India, according to Narendra Khadka, chair of the Nepal Ginger Entrepreneurs’ Association.  India had banned the import of ginger two years ago, alleging that Nepali ginger was impure. Crops worth millions went to waste as a result. “It all depends on India’s whim,” he said.  Indian customs officials also ask for bribes of up to Rs50,000 per truckload, he said. Each truck carries 13 to 22 tonnes of ginger.  “We have informed the government and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu, but the demand for bribes hasn't stopped.” Nepal grows around 300,000 tonnes of ginger annually, making it the world's third largest producer after China and India. One-third of this annual harvest comes from the eastern region. Traders said that 90 percent of the ginger produced in Nepal is exported to the Indian market.  In the fiscal year 2019-20, Nepal exported 8,846 tonnes of ginger worth about Rs435 million. India and Bangladesh are the major markets for Nepali ginger. Nepal exports tea worth nearly Rs3 billion annually, according to data from the Mechi Customs Office. Most of the tea is orthodox tea which, according to Mittal, is of the best kind.  Demand for CTC tea produced in the Tarai belt is also high, he said. The major market for Nepali tea is India, but India also sends its tea to Pakistan and Europe and America. Often, the tea re-exported by India to third countries is of Nepali origin, Nepali tea entrepreneurs say. In Jhapa, the tea acreage has expanded to 9,489 hectares, according to the Tea and Coffee Development Board. An estimated 15,954 tonnes of tea is produced annually. Laxman Pokhrel, information officer at the National Tea and Coffee Development Board, said that his office hadn’t received any complaints about low prices or other unfair practices in the tea business from farmers.  “As far as we know, tea farmers have been getting good returns for their produce,” he told the Post. “We are in talks about exporting our product to not just India but other countries too. We will announce our decision soon.” Last year, agro products worth about Rs5.26 billion were exported from the Mechi Customs point. Shipments have slumped this fiscal year due to the coronavirus crisis, dealing another blow to already embattled farmers.  “As of now, the local unit only determines the price of tea. But we are not in contact with ginger and large cardamom farmers, so farmers sell it to whoever they like at whatever price is fixed between them,” said Bir Bahadur Lapcha, spokesperson for Suryodaya Municipality, Ilam. Govinda Acharya, nodal officer at the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, said that most farmers do not produce on a large scale, and they sell their crops from their farms to middlemen because they need quick money.  There are plenty of things we need to consider before exporting our products to third countries, he added. “There is no purification equipment, and traders don’t pay much for unprocessed products. We don’t have processing and cold storage facilities,” he said. “Before we attempt to export to other countries, we need to test the products for quality and use of pesticides. For exporting to third countries, we need to grade the products and there should be a policy decision regarding tariffs.”  But farmers like Pema Yolmo want simpler solutions that will help them get a fair price. He said that establishing an auction market in the district would allow farmers to get better rates for their crops.

93,"Coronavirus cuts foreign currency earnings from tourism by 19 percent in 2019-20, a report says","August 26, 2020","Nepal’s foreign exchange earnings from tourism in the last fiscal year were down 19.2 percent as the industry shuttered in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic from March-end. According to Nepal Rastra Bank’s annual macroeconomic report released on Monday, revenues shrank to Rs60.88 billion in the last fiscal year ended mid-July, a year-on-year loss of nearly Rs15 billion. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism are calculated by adding the tourist service charge collected at the airport and monies earned by hotels and travel agencies, among other establishments. The calculation is also based on data received from money changers.  The government had set a tourism revenue target of Rs200 billion as Nepal was celebrating Visit Nepal 2020 expecting to attract at least 2 million visitors. But the virus played spoilsport and upended its plans. Money flow during the four-month period extending from mid-March to mid-July totalled a paltry Rs6 billion, that too from arriving representatives of diplomatic missions and development partners, according to industry insiders.  During the period mid-April to mid-May, revenues reached a low of Rs861 million, a far cry from the average monthly income of Rs6 billion during happier times.  Arrivals during the months of April, May, June and July numbered 13, 30, 100 and 195 individuals respectively, almost all of them diplomatic personnel. Nepal used to receive more than 70,000 visitors monthly during the same period last year. The tourism industry has never seen such a catastrophe since the first foreign sightseers began arriving in the 1950s after Nepal opened its doors to the world by establishing direct air links with several Indian cities. Insiders say things weren't this bad even during the Maoist insurgency (1996-2006) and the 2015 earthquakes. The virus has dealt a knockout blow, and the once booming tourism sector is unlikely to get back on its feet any time soon, they say. The global tourism industry has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, with $320 billion lost in exports in the first five months of the year, and more than 120 million jobs at risk, the United Nations said Tuesday. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a policy briefing and video address that tourism was the third largest export sector of the global economy, behind fuels and chemicals; and in 2019, it accounted for 7 percent of global trade. “It employs one in every 10 people on Earth and provides livelihoods to hundreds of millions more,” he said. According to the UN, the export revenues from tourism could fall by $910 billion to $1.2 trillion in 2020 and that could reduce global GDP by 1.5 percent to 2.8 percent. In addition to tourism jobs that are at risk, it said.  Nepal has also witnessed job losses numbering in the tens of thousands in the tourism industry, particularly in the mountain regions that totally rely on tourism earnings.  Dhananjay Regmi, chief executive officer of the Nepal Tourism Board, said that Covid-19 had caused a big setback to the tourism industry, and job losses particularly in mountain tourism has been huge. The board, in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme-Nepal, has launched a job retention programme particularly in mountain tourism, he said. “We have planned to employ 5,000 people to clean and repair trekking trails in three phases,” he said. ""In the first phase with a Rs14 million budget, we have planned to employ at least 250 people in temporary jobs that will last up to 45 days,"" said Regmi. In the second phase, the board plans to allocate a Rs36 million budget.  “Workers employed in cleaning and repairing trekking trails will be paid Rs1,000 per day. In addition, the local rural municipalities will provide an additional Rs400 to Rs500 daily to the workers,” said Regmi. The board has launched the first phase programme on three trekking routes—Khumbu trekking up to Everest base camp, Toni Hagen trekking route in Madi Rural Municipality in Kaski and a trekking trail in Annapurna base camp.  “This is the beginning. As the tourism sector doesn’t look like getting on track immediately, we have planned to launch more job retention programmes in the future,” said Regmi. The government said on July 20 that international and domestic flights would resume starting August 17, and asked the travel and tourism industry to accept bookings for the autumn season accordingly. But the rising number of coronavirus cases made the officials backtrack. Again on August 21, the government decided to re-start charter and regular passenger flights from September 1. But only Nepalis and representatives of diplomatic missions, the United Nations and development partners will be allowed to fly into Nepal, and restrictions on foreign tourists will remain in place until further notice.

94,"Nepal, India in talks to build oil pipelines, gas plant and storage facilities","August 25, 2020","Nepal and India are planning to launch several multimillion-dollar petroleum projects as they explore potential areas of cooperation in the oil sector. At least three new petroleum and gas pipelines, a liquefied petroleum gas plant and a number of oil storage facilities have been proposed to be built in Nepal while discussions are awaited on the funding modalities, government officials said.  The second meeting of the Nepal-India Joint Working Group on oil and gas cooperation held through video conferencing on August 13 talked about building a natural gas pipeline from Gorakhpur to Bhairahawa and an oil pipeline from Siliguri to Jhapa. Officials also discussed extending the oil pipeline from Amlekhganj to Lothar in Chitwan. The meeting was chaired by Prem Kumar Shrestha, joint secretary of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Supplies on behalf of the Nepal government while BN Reddy, joint secretary at the Indian Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas co-chaired the meeting on behalf of the Indian government. “A number of studies are being conducted jointly for the projects,” Shrestha told the Post. According to Shrestha, discussions were also held on building petroleum storage facilities in Dhanusha and Lothar besides a liquefied petroleum gas bottling plant in Jhapa.  As per reports, Indian officials are expected to visit Nepal soon to explore possible routes for the new pipelines. On September 10, 2019, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi jointly inaugurated South Asia’s first cross-border petroleum pipeline. The 69-kilometre pipeline pumps fuel from India’s Barauni refinery in Bihar to Amlekhganj in Nepal. Of the pipeline's total length, 36 kilometres lies within Nepali territory. According to Nepal Oil Corporation, it has been able to save Rs2 billion annually in freight charges, and also avoid the vagaries of transportation by tanker truck after gasoline started flowing through the pipeline. It currently takes at least 14 hours to transport oil from Patna in India to Amlekhganj. Indian Oil Corporation has been the sole supplier of fuel to Nepal Oil Corporation since 1974. Shrestha said that detailed project reports of some of the schemes are being prepared, and a number of them are at the final stages. In February, a team from Indian Oil Corporation, which built the Amlekhganj pipeline, conducted a survey for the pipeline connecting Nepal Oil Corporation's depot at Charali, Jhapa with Siliguri, which lies across the eastern border in West Bengal, India. Experts carried out the survey in Batasi in northern West Bengal, about 3 kilometres from the India-Bangladesh border and Jyamirgadi in Jhapa. The survey team also studied three rivers—Mechi, Ninda and Hadiya—on the east-west highway, according to officials at Nepal Oil Corporation.  The distance between the Indian Oil Corporation depot in Siliguri and the Nepal Oil Corporation depot in Charali is 50 kilometres. According to Shrestha, the feasibility of all new projects is being discussed at the request of the Nepal government. The Economic Times published from India reported that a team of Indian officials would soon visit Nepal to explore the possible routes for a new product pipeline which would be followed by feasibility studies before investment decisions are finalised. “There is potential for expanding the pipeline network that would bring a lot of savings for the Himalayan country,” the daily said. According to the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, the country imported petroleum products worth Rs164 billion in the last fiscal year, a year-on-year drop of 24.2 percent caused by Covid-19 restrictions that kept most vehicles off the roads.",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/08/25/nepal-india-in-talks-to-build-oil-pipelines-gas-plant-and-storage-facilities
95,Remittance defies projections of a massive drop,"August 24, 2020","Remittance inflows dropped by a marginal 0.5 percent in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July, despite popular labour markets in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Malaysia being severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic that left millions of expat workers with no choice but to pack their bags and leave. According to the Nepal Rastra Bank’s annual macroeconomic report released on Monday, Nepali migrant workers sent home Rs 875.03 billion in the last fiscal year. The report shows that Nepal received an all-time high remittance of Rs 100.16 billion during the last month of the fiscal year (mid-June to mid-July) that boosted the overall remittance earning. The central bank said that the number of Nepali workers seeking approval for foreign employment decreased by 20.5 percent to 193,945 individuals in the review period. Similarly, the number of Nepali workers (renew entry) seeking approval for foreign employment decreased 34.7 percent to 177,980 individuals in the last fiscal year.  “We had initially expected that Covid-19 would cause a severe contraction to remittance earning as tens of thousands of Nepalis were reported to return home,” said Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson for the country’s central bank. “But the country did not see migrant workers returning home in big volumes.” He said that migrant workers may have felt safe to live where they were given the ill-preparation to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic at home. Some labour rights activists said that the high airfare cost was the key reason thousands of migrant workers could not fly back home from different labour destinations.  As of Monday, according to Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre statistics, more than 52,000 Nepalis have returned home—majority of them from the labour destinations.  According to the centre, the highest arrivals of 14,745 were from the United Arab Emirates, followed by Saudi Arabia 7,817 and Malaysia 7,795. Similarly, 6,320 returned home from Kuwait and 5,668 from Qatar.  In April-end, a little over a month after the lockdown was imposed on March 24, the Nepal Rastra Bank had projected a drop of over 15 percent in remittances in the last fiscal year 2019-20. In the same month, the World Bank also projected remittances to go down by 14 percent. Similarly, the Central Bureau of Statistics also projected a reduction of Rs163 billion, or over 18 percent. “But all of their assumptions were wrong,” said Bhatta. He said that the estimate was based on April’s remittance earnings that saw a sharp drop. However, after April, there had been a noticeable improvement in remittances.  There are few factors, according to Bhatta, which did not affect the remittance much. “As the source countries, mainly Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman are still continuing their manufacturing activities, migrant workers have not been laid off in expected numbers,” said Bhatta. “We have also estimated that the informal trade has decreased by the restrictions and lockdowns that eventually have helped remittance come through formal channels. According to Bhatta, remittance in large chunks is coming through formal channels unlike in the past. “Besides, migrant workers who have returned home may have brought back their savings,” Bhatta, who is also the chief of the central bank’s research department, told the Post. “The outlook, too, is not disappointing as international crude oil prices have started to increase, backed by renewal orders from China.”  As falling oil prices will affect remittance outflows from GCC countries and Malaysia, the gradual recovery will mean demand for workers will also rise gradually, according to him.",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/08/24/remittance-defies-projections-of-a-massive-drop
96,Hetauda Cement's losses jump fivefold as virus hits construction and sales,"August 24, 2020","Hetauda Cement Industries' losses jumped fivefold year-on-year as Covid-19 stalled construction activities and cement sales plunged to new lows. The state-owned company racked up losses totalling Rs50 million in the last fiscal year ended mid-July. This is the second consecutive year of losses after the company started making a profit in fiscal 2015-16. According to its audit report, losses in the previous fiscal year 2018-19 amounted to Rs10.5 million. General Manager Prem Shankar Singh said they suffered losses in 2018-19 due to machinery breakdowns. “Production and sales of cement declined due to Covid-19 restrictions in the last fiscal year,” he said. He added that a full audit report was yet to come. According to the factory, it was able to sell only 1.45 million bags of cement and clinker out of the 1.9 million bags it produced in the last fiscal year.  Sarju Aryal, head of the sales division, said the factory was left with about 400,000 bags of unsold cement due to lost business during the peak construction season which lasts from mid-March to mid-May.  “It was largely due to Covid-19 triggered lockdowns and restrictions. The factory stopped clinker production for two weeks due to excess stock in the warehouse. “The virus is also making it difficult to import coal. We are preparing to resume clinker production by August-end as soon as the remaining inventory of cement is sold,” said Singh. The factory produced about 2.3 million bags of cement and sold 2 million bags in the previous fiscal year. In 2007-08, the factory was operating at 53 percent of capacity. During that time, its net profit stood at Rs90 million. The profit increased to Rs110 million in 2009-10. Then it went into the red for three consecutive years from 2012-13 to 2014-15.  The factory earned a profit of Rs40 million in 2015-16, despite encountering problems triggered by the trade embargo.  ""Even after the Covid-19 crisis ends, it will be difficult to turn a profit without expanding the production capacity. We have already submitted a proposal to the federal Ministry of Industry for capacity development and a report with the estimated amount of capital injection required,” Singh said. Established in 1976 at Hetauda Municipality-9, Lamsure, the factory started commercial production in 1991. ""It is necessary to reduce the cost of production by adding new equipment to compete with the private sector cement industry,"" Singh said. The factory employs 370 persons and requires 1,000 tonnes of limestone daily. According to the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, the country imported cement valued at Rs454 million in the last fiscal year 2019-20, a sharp 65.4 percent fall from the previous fiscal year when imports amounted to Rs1.31 billion. Clinker imports were worth Rs4.41 billion, down 62.2 percent compared to the previous fiscal year when imports stood at Rs11.67 billion. Dhurba Raj Thapa, president of the Cement Manufacturers Association of Nepal, said that cement factories remained closed for two months during the lockdown that started from March 24. They have resumed operations but only partially as there is no demand for their products in the market, he said. According to him, demand for cement has plunged 80 percent with both government and private sector construction projects at a standstill due to Covid-19 and official measures to stop the spread of virus by allowing the transportation of only essential goods. Thapa said that the turnover of the overall cement industry was around Rs600 million daily, and it suffered losses totalling Rs30 billion during the lockdown period.”",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/08/24/hetauda-cement-s-losses-jump-fivefold-as-virus-hits-construction-and-sales
97,Government looks for more loans as debt balloons,"August 24, 2020","Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada during his regular briefing to the media on Friday spoke at length about his conversation with Hartwig Schafer, World Bank’s vice-president for the South Asia Region earlier that day. The video conference focussed on Nepal’s needs to borrow more funds from the World Bank in the face of loss of revenue for economic recovery, implementation of new programmes which include disaster management, capital expenditure for infrastructure projects and to prepare for a digital economy.  “Currently we have the largest portfolio of the World Bank that we can mobilise,” Khatiwada told the briefing. “They are related to health and economic recovery and infrastructure development. An assistance worth around Rs 100 billion meant for energy, tourism and some other sectors are also in the pipeline.” The government signed several loan agreements with the World Bank worth $949 million in the last fiscal year 2019-20 and is negotiating with the World Bank for at least $750 million additional loans in the areas like tourism and urban infrastructure. These loan agreements and the last week’s talks come as Nepal’s has nearly trebled in the last six years.  Besides the World Bank, it has also sought support from donor agencies like Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Development Bank, International Monetary Fund and other bilateral donors, as the country faces a resource crunch to revive the economy from the Covid-19 crisis.  “We are very concerned about the foreign aid landscape during and post Covid scenario,” he said during a virtual meeting with donors in April, according to the Finance Ministry statement.  According to the Financial Comptroller General Office, the office responsible for keeping record of income and expenditure of the government, the total debt of the government increased to Rs1.41 trillion at the end of the fiscal year 2019-20 from Rs544.91 billion in the fiscal year 2014-15.  While comparing total debt to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country, the debt has reached 40.16 percent of GDP in the last fiscal year compared to 25.65 percent of GDP in fiscal 2014-15, the financial comptroller general office said.  “Although the ratio of debt compared to GDP is on the rise, we still have space to grow debt,” said Uttar Kumar Khatri, spokesperson at the finance ministry. “The debt to GDP ratio in Nepal is relatively lower compared to many other countries in similar development status.” He said that the country would benefit well if the loans could be received at a cheaper interest rate and that could be utilised in activities that contribute to capital formation. But, experts say that the space of receiving more loans is tightening after the debt to GDP ratio crossed 40 percent. According to the Nepal Development Update, published by the World Bank last month, Nepal’s debt to GDP ratio is estimated to reach 43.5 percent by the end of current fiscal year. “We are safe till now because the debt to GDP ratio is below 50 percent but the time has now come to be cautious and serious about the debt sustainability of the country,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of Nepal Rastra Bank. The government has significantly increased external borrowing in recent years as it increased the budget size massively. Big amounts were allocated for various infrastructure projects and the budget for salary of the government staff and social security increased. Most resources required for post-earthquake reconstruction were also generated from external loans. On the other hand, foreign donors, particularly multilateral donors agencies, have adopted a policy of only providing loans to Nepal in recent years with its relatively low debt to GDP ratio which now has contributed to the sudden rise in Nepal’s public debt.  With revenue drying up due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic Nepal is asking the development partners to increase lending. In April, the government had sought additional funding—in the range of Rs69 billion to Rs104 billion— from international multilateral donors per year to cover the increased health care costs in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Khatiwada admitted in a press meet earlier this month that resource management during the pandemic could be possible due to cooperation from multilateral and bilateral donor agencies including the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, European countries, Japan, South Korea and neighbouring countries.  Thus, on one hand, Nepal is in need of mobilising more foreign loans to fight Covid-19 while, on the other hand, the ratio of public debt is going up rapidly. There is also the need to balance economic indicators and the failure in this would lead to more risk of indebtedness.  “This has given tough time to the policy makers whether to focus on macro-economic management by keeping debt ratio at a comfortable level or take risk to revive the economy,” said Thapa, who had also worked as a policy advisor on macro-economic management at the International Monetary Fund in late 2000s. High public debt means the government needs to spend a huge amount paying principal and interest, which otherwise can be used in development activities and delivering public services. The burden of debt will be huge for the future generation.  The government on the other hand is confident of securing more debt as problem projects funded with World Bank money have gone down to three from the earlier six to seven.  “Last year we were among the countries that got the best results from World Bank aid,” said Khatiwada Friday.  In the early 2000s when the Maoist insurgency was at its peak, the government’s treasury was under severe duress. But, the country’s debt to GDP had reached as high as 63.9 percent for 2001-02. Senior government officials at that time said there was not enough money in the state coffers to pay salaries to government employees and there was high demand for a budget for security agencies to fight insurgency. But, the high debt ratio was creating trouble. “Whenever Nepal Rastra Bank sent us treasury positions on a weekly basis, only a few of us had access to that report. We used to repay high-interest loans without the knowledge of many people, so that demands for more resources from the security agencies could be avoided,” said former auditor general Bhanu Acharya, who was Finance Secretary in the early 2000s.  Amid requests of the government, multilateral donors started to provide more grants to Nepal which helped ease the situation. The revenue also peaked up after the insurgency was over, which brought down the debt ratio in the following years.  But, in recent years, the debt ratio is also on the rise again. As per the Medium Term Expenditure Framework published by the National Planning Commission, an estimated additional resources of Rs1.72 trillion would be generated as public debt by fiscal 2022-23.  With a possibility of a heavy rise in debt ratio, Nepal may have to raise tax in the future to raise revenue to pay the loans in the future. The World Bank has suggested that interest rates remain low in Nepal to aid economic recovery. Thapa said that despite the risk of high levels of debt, the country has no choice but to revive the economy first.  ‘If we can revive the economy with the use of loans by completing the projects that are in the final phase and investing the amount in creating gainful employment, the debt ratio can be minimised while boosting the economy at the same time,” said Thapa. But, concerns have been raised over whether the government would opt for loans even in the projects that are politically guided. Loans approved by the World Bank to run the Prime Minister Employment Programme invited scrutiny amid reports that the budget was being allocated for pulling out weeds at roads. The World Bank last year had approved a $120 million loan to implement the programme which is aimed at guaranteeing a minimum 100 days of paid employment to poor citizens. Amid the pandemic, the government aims to expand this programme to create employment to 200,000 in the current fiscal year compared to 60,000 last year as a large number of Nepalis lost their jobs at home and abroad.",Money,https://kathmandupost.com/money/2020/08/24/government-looks-for-more-loans-as-debt-balloons
98,"Pesticide residue testing labs at border points need upgrading, officials say","August 24, 2020","Officials at the Central Agriculture Laboratory say that the pesticide residue testing labs at the border points need to be upgraded so they can test for a wider range of pesticide residues in the fruits and vegetables that enter Nepal. Tens of thousands of tonnes of fruits and vegetables are imported from India every year, but not one test result has come back positive for pesticide residues which is surprising, say officials. They say that the equipment at the labs at the border points must be defective or the shipments are being allowed into the country without being tested.  In the last fiscal year, none of the samples tested by the Rapid Bioassay Pesticide Residue Unit in Sarlahi, Rupandehi and Banke was found to be contaminated. The Rapid Bioassay Pesticide Residue Unit at Kalimati detected an enzyme inhibition percentage of above 45 percent in 29 samples of fruits and vegetables which were grown locally and imported, which means they are not fit to be eaten. Of the total 1,877 samples collected in the last fiscal year, 1,838 were found with an enzyme inhibition percentage of below 35 percent, which means good to eat; and 10 samples were found with an enzyme inhibition percentage of 35-45 percent, which means they needed to be put in quarantine for two days. Most of the fruits and vegetables found with pesticide residues are banana, orange, tomato, cauliflower, beans and sponge gourd.  The Rapid Bioassay Pesticide Residue Units in the country test for carbamate and organophosphate pesticides. ""Most of the pesticides under the organophosphate group have been banned in Nepal and other countries, but this does not mean that they are not using other pesticides that can be harmful to human health,"" said Prakash Ghimire, plant directorate officer at the Central Agriculture Laboratory. “We have not been able to check for other types of pesticides besides carbamate and organophosphate,” he said. “We cannot say that the imported vegetables are free of pesticides on the basis of sample tests done for two groups of pesticides.”  The labs need to be upgraded so that they can test for most of the pesticides used in India, he added.  ""There are a few determining factors that might have impacted the tests for pesticide residues,"" Ghimire said. ""First, as the Rapid Bioassay Pesticide Residue Units in Nepal have been testing for organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, other types of pesticides may have been applied on the imported fruits and vegetables. The pesticide residue might also have been eliminated in transit.""  Weaknesses in the sampling procedure at the customs points can also be a reason for the good results. This has raised questions over the capacity of the regional level lab units, said an official in the unit. “Imported fruits and vegetables arriving with zero pesticide residues is somewhat strange. There may be something wrong,” said the official.  ""The fruits and vegetables consumed by humans need to be pesticide residue-free, whichever pesticide is used,"" Ghimire said. Of the 12,557 samples tested by the Sarlahi unit, all of them showed an enzyme inhibition percentage of below 35 percent, which means they are fit to be eaten. The Kaski unit that collected 103 samples found 98 samples were fit to be eaten. The Rupandehi unit that collected 30,973 samples found that 30,967 samples were edible. Banke collected 10,443 samples among which 10,443 samples were found to be fit to eat. The Kailali unit collected 6,208 samples and 6,198 were found to be fit to eat. The Rapid Bioassay Pesticide Residue Units at Kalimati, Jhapa, Sarlahi, Kaski, Rupandehi, Banke and Kailali collected a total of 76,322 samples of fruits and vegetables. According to the Kalimati unit, an enzyme inhibition percentage of below 35 percent means fit to be eaten, 35-45 percent means the products need to be kept in quarantine for a few days, and above 45 percent means they are not fit to be eaten and have to be destroyed. Complaints have been received that imported fruits and vegetables found with pesticide residues are also being sold as they cannot be returned according to trade rules, said the lab.  The Kalimati unit has been testing local and imported vegetables and fruits for pesticide residues, he said, adding that the unit has also been testing for pesticide residues when any regional unit is closed. Last year, it destroyed a shipment of asparagus from Thailand after finding pesticide residues of more than 45 percent.

99,"Lack of clarity in rules, and hindrances drive e-retailers to operate amid confusion","August 23, 2020","On Tuesday, Surakchya Adhikari, co-founder and Chief Operating Officer at Thulo.com, an online retail store, was busy looking over at the numbers of orders the company had received for Teej. But as the day came to end, a Cabinet meeting decided to implement prohibitory orders in the Valley to curb the spread of Covid-19 starting Wednesday midnight. “With the immediate restriction order, I did not get the time to properly plan for the delivery of goods the next day. And amid confusion and a lack of clarity, we had to remain closed for the next two days,” Adhikari said. The sudden shuttering of operations meant she could not make the most of the festive week, a time when sales would have peaked, she says.  The government’s immediate decision of shutting down the Valley has added stress to e-retailers already struggling from the initial lockdown, which lasted from March to June, and is causing them operational hindrances. E-retailers are uncertain as to how they can go about managing and planning their supply system and stock. “It has been more than five months that pandemic hit the nation but the government has not been able to come up with an operation strategy for e-commerce and address the problem for delivering essential goods,” said Subal Chitrakar, co-founder and operation head at Sasto Deal, another online retailer. Agreeing with Chitrakar, Adhikari said that since the lockdown began on March 24, the government has neither realised the importance of e-commerce at the time of pandemic nor formulated a strategy for such services to operate smoothly.  For instance, Adhikari said that the government has still not clearly mentioned whether two-wheelers are allowed to deliver or not. Delivering goods on two-wheelers in comparison to four-wheelers is comparatively more efficient, say e-retailers. But nothing has been defined yet. Confusion arose on Thursday morning when despite the government stating that the supply of essential goods will be allowed to operate, police administration stopped delivery. E-retailers were flooded with orders amid the festival Teej but due to the restriction orders, deliveries were delayed and orders were cancelled, said e-traders. But now, three days into the week-long restrictions, e-retailers are now allowed to deliver all day but with vendors allowed to open shop for limited time they are having problems managing stock, they say.   “As the market is open only for a certain time, we are also facing problems with the supply part,” said Adhikari. Anil Basnet, founder and CEO of MetroTarkari, said that as the vegetable wholesale market is open only until 7 am in the morning, they are having problems in supplying vegetables. “Vendors have been running out of stock and the limited time has impacted our deliveries,” says Basnet.  The delivery numbers have also been reduced. While earlier they were getting 50-60 orders on a daily basis, from Thursday they have been getting only 25-30 orders, said Basnet. “It is high time the government implements delivery policy or stable operation rules so that business does not get impacted by the sudden implementation of safety measures,” Adhikari said. The demand for online delivery of daily consumable goods has swelled in the Valley since the beginning of lockdown, with people preferring to order online rather visiting the market physically, said e-traders. But with no e-commerce policy in the country, there is a lack of clarity and communication from the government, affecting daily operations, said e-retailers. The proposed E-commerce Bill 2020 law, which had been sent to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies by the Department of Commerce, Supply and Consumer Protection in July, is yet to be reviewed before it is submitted to the Cabinet for its approval which is under discussion. “We have been waiting for e-commerce policy so that it would be lawfully easy for us to operate our businesses,” said Adhikari. “We have been following safety protocol strictly, as an infection in our delivery team will have a deep impact on the team and business too,” she said. But the government too has to do their bit, she added. Unless the government comes up with policies that ensure smooth operations for e-commerce, such sudden orders will have an impact on the businesses, says Chitrakar. “The government needs to come up with clear rules so that no confusion occurs for the businesses that are trying their best to survive the pandemic,” he added. According to e-commerce traders, the e-commerce market in Nepal is worth around $35-40 million with 300 percent growth largely due to growing smartphone users and increasing internet penetration in the country.

100,The loneliness of the football fan,"September 6, 2020","There is this man I know. I will call him K. K and I got talking about football and I asked him which Premier League team he supported. He said he was a Chelsea fan although he used to be an Arsenal one. “These days Arsenal makes me mad,” he added with hardly comprehensible indignation. I inwardly chuckled but said nothing. After a while I said that I had never come across a fan who had switched his team. “You have now,” he replied with disdain. That left me wondering about him. K must have become a Chelsea fan when they were a dominant force in the mid-noughties after Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich bankrolled the team’s success. Or maybe it was a little later when his older team Arsenal started their slide from the late noughties onwards. He wanted to support a winner but not Manchester United, the most dominant force in English football between the early 1990s and early 2010s, because. Well because, that was too obvious a team to pick wasn’t it? He had supported Arsenal because they challenged the serial winner in the first place.  So why does a football fan support one Premier League team rather than another? In England the answer to a large extent would be because it is the local club. But elsewhere there probably are a variety of reasons.  Maybe they were the winning team when one first started watching the game. Maybe they when one first started watching the game had enough in them to challenge the big boys. Maybe one is just a sucker for underdogs. Maybe they were the team one was introduced to early on by a dear one. Maybe that was the team one’s circle supported and was easier to make conversation about. Maybe they were the team whose style playing, or otherwise, one liked. Maybe one just liked the manager for his no nonsense style, his sartorial sense, his antics on the touchline, his looks or whatever. Maybe they were the team that had an attractive player, whether in looks or playing style, and you fell for the team because of him. There could so many more.  It is easy to continue to support a team if they continue to win trophies. We all love winners, after all. Besides the pure pleasure of enjoying the success, one gets bragging rights with one’s friends, one gets a vicarious thrill, and one gets a sense of comfort when other things may not be going one’s way. One feels one has a pretty girl or a handsome guy by one’s side and is the envy of others.  But then even success gets boring after a while. On the other hand if one’s team’s fortune is in a steady decline it becomes challenging and in perverse sense enjoyable too. One does not want to just abandon the team and jump ship because over time one has expended time, energy and emotions for the team. One has developed an affinity for the team, one identifies with the team. Of course one could always go out with a prettier girl or a better looking guy. But what about all the time you spent with the earlier one? In football the players change, the managers change and even the owners change but the fan remains.  Now the question that arises is how much of the pain can one bear. One had expected so much from one’s team but every year one gets disappointed. One can’t take it anymore. One wants to wash one’s hands of the team but it’s not so easy. One is in a lonely place. Why is the football so important if it is so much trouble? Maybe the famous Liverpool manager Bill Shankly had something when he said, “Some people think football is a matter of life and death. I assure you it is much more serious than that.”",Sports,https://kathmandupost.com/premier-league-watch/2020/09/06/the-loneliness-of-the-football-fan
101,Football in the time of corona,"August 28, 2020","These, to use a cliché, are surreal times. A month or so after the end of the last season the new Premier League season is just two weeks away. In between there have been the final stages of the Champions and Europa leagues. Other European leagues like the Scottish League and French Ligue 1 are already underway. The Community Shield, the traditional curtain raiser in the English game, has been brought forward by a week, to make way for international matches taking place next week, and is being played this weekend. There is no certainty how this season will pan out. Even before the new season begins there have been reports five Chelsea players have tested positive as has Paul Pogba of Manchester United. Despite some opposition from a section of the players, the league was completed last season mainly because of contractual obligations to television companies. Premier League teams are yet to decide on their options if there are disruptions this season. One scenario being considered is accepting the standings as final if 50 percent of the league is completed. One can only hope it does not come to that but instead there will be some fans on the stands before long. Brighton is already planning that.  Despite the abnormality of the whole situation, the season break has had a ring of normality. Transfer business has been going and will continue, unusually, till early October. Chelsea have been the prime movers in the market so far, as if to make up for the ban last season. Noises continue to come out from other teams chasing their targets. Players have been on truncated summer holidays to the beaches of the Caribbean, Greece and Dubai. And they have been up to their usual antics – Harry Maguire got into an illegal scuffle and Raheem Sterling was partying as if social distancing did not apply to him.  As for the actual game on the pitch, all bets would be on Liverpool or Manchester City to lift the trophy. Manchester United and Chelsea fans would want to believe their teams too have a chance. To be fair, this is football and no one has a crystal ball. Liverpool could be hit with complacency as losing to Arsenal and drawing against Burnley towards the end of last season showed. Manchester City’s defence is still suspect, rumours of the great Lionel Messi teaming up with Pep Guardiola notwithstanding. Manchester United were a team transformed after the arrival of Portuguese Bruno Fernandes during the January transfer window and Pogba, on his day, can be up there with the best in world. But their coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer still has his doubters and questions over their defence persist. Frank Lampard did not seem to know his best team till the end of last season and with significant new arrivals he has little time to lose before he knows his best eleven this season.  Then there are the contenders for the top four places. Leicester City surprised everyone until the coronavirus break last season when they were sitting pretty at third place. Maybe because their coach Brendon Rodgers caught the coronavirus or because they had been punching above their weight they could not keep the momentum going after the enforced break and ended up fifth. With Ben Chilwell off to Chelsea, fourth place is unlikely. Wolves have defied expectations for the last two seasons since their promotion from the Championship in 2018. But fourth place may be a bridge too far. That leaves Tottenham and Arsenal as realistic contenders for the top four. Jose Mourhino will not have a lot to spend on transfers at Tottenham but he will have a point to prove that he can perform without expensive signings. Arsenal were surprise winners of the FA Cup last season and their performance against Liverpool in the Community Shield will be an early marker for their season.

There were no fans to witness the triumph but Bayern celebrated as though 80,000 were cheering and, even as the lights went out nearly two hours after the final whistle, three players still sat in the centre circle, savouring the moment. The victory at the Estadio da Luz, deserved after a dogged display once Bayern got in front, secured a second treble for the Germans, the Bundesliga and German Cup winners, and completed a remarkable first season for coach Hansi Flick. Flick took over a struggling side in November, after a 5-1 hammering by Eintracht Frankfurt led to the sacking of Niko Kovac with the club fourth in the Bundesliga. “It feels fantastic, we have a long journey behind us,” said Bayern midfielder Thomas Mueller. “We came from very low, at least that is what it felt like, in the autumn and put in a sensational run. We had a bit of luck tonight and had (Manuel) Neuer in goal,” he added. PSG, who were playing in their first Champions League final, paid the price for wastefulness in the first half as Neymar and Kylian Mbappe failed to beat Neuer from close range. The French club has benefitted from huge investment by Qatari Sports Investments but, while dominant in their domestic league, they fell short at the final hurdle in Europe. “We’re sad but we don’t forget all the positive things we did this season,” said PSG’s Qatari president Nasser al Khelaifi. Inspired decision  Flick opted to start with Coman instead of Croatian Ivan Perisic on the left flank and it was an inspired decision. Jerome Boateng was deemed fit to start in Bayern’s central defence, having recovered from a knock picked up in the semi-final win over Olympique Lyonnais. After a cagey opening, Neymar burst into life in the 18th minute, scampering into the box and firing off a left-foot shot but Neuer’s outstretched leg foiled the Brazilian. It was hardly an easy chance but it was the kind of opportunity that PSG fans were hoping their 222 million euro ($261.89 million) striker would turn into a moment of glory. Four minutes later Bayern’s goal threat, Robert Lewandowski, was found in the box by a left wing cross from Alphonso Davies and given too much room to turn but his shot struck the post. PSG were certainly asking questions of the Bayern defence and the livewire Angel Di Maria, after a quick exchange on the edge of the area, created space for a shot but his effort, with his weaker right foot, flew high and wide. Bayern’s gamble to start Boateng looked misplaced when he hobbled off in the 25th minute, being replaced by Niklas Suele. PSG’s industrious midfielder Ander Herrera then had a fierce effort from distance deflected wide, while at the other end Lewandowski’s stooping header from close range forced a fine reflex save out of Navas. Mbappe, PSG’s talented French World Cup-winning striker, should have done better just before the break when, after a smart one-two with Herrera, he shot straight at Neuer. Coman header It was a scrappy start to the second half with both sides struggling to find any composure but the game came alive just before the hour mark. After a well worked move down the right Joshua Kimmich picked out Coman at the back post and he got behind Thilo Kehrer to head firmly into the bottom corner. Coman threatened in the same area again moments later, after Mueller found him with a cross, and Thiago Silva had to block the volley. Bayern were starting to look in control and PSG coach Thomas Tuchel responded by throwing on his Italian midfielder Marco Verratti in a bid to change the momentum. But Flick’s side were in no mood to give up their lead and they fought for every ball with tenacity, reducing any chance PSG had to find openings for their expensive strikeforce. One final opportunity did come, in stoppage time, when Mbappe broke down the inside-left channel and found Neymar who turned sharply but saw his shot go harmlessly wide.",Sports,https://kathmandupost.com/football/2020/08/24/steely-bayern-edge-psg-to-claim-champions-league-crown
103,Premier League versus Europe,"August 22, 2020","Last year was an aberration. All four finalists in Europe were Premier League teams. Liverpool played Tottenham in the Champions League final and Chelsea met Arsenal in the Europa League. Before last year only once had two Premier League teams played in the Champions League final. In 2008 Manchester United beat Chelsea on penalties after John Terry slipped while taking his penalty kick during the shootout on a rain drenched pitch in Moscow. There have never been two Premier League teams in the Europa League final. Fans of the Premier League must be forgiven to feel that English teams deserve to be fighting for glory in Europe every year. After all, the world’s best coaches ply their trade here, it outspends other leagues handsomely in buying players and paying them mouthwatering wages and the stadiums are packed with raucous fans. But this year there was no English team among the Champions League semi finalists. Manchester City ignominiously lost to Lyon in the quarter final.  Having beaten Real Madrid in the round of 16, one could be forgiven to hope that it was their year. Despite the billion of Abu Dhabi oil money being spent on the squad, European glory eludes them. The best they have gone so far is semi-final in the 2015-16 season. Pep Guardiola was made the highest paid coach in the world to help the Sheikhs bask in glory but it has not been so. Having won the Champions League twice with Barcelona they thought the Spaniard was the one but they have been disappointed yet again. No Lionel Messi, no glory for him. In the three years at Bayern Munich, Guardiola did not even reach the final.  In the 28 years since the Premier League was established from the old First Division in the England, English teams have won the Champions League a sum total of five times – Manchester United twice, Liverpool twice and Chelsea once. The mid-noughties were the heydays of the Premier League teams in Europe’s elite competition. Liverpool beat AC Milan in the 2004-5 miracle of Istanbul, the next year Arsenal with ten men for much of the game fought valiantly against Barcelona, the year after that AC Milan took their revenge against Liverpool, in 2007-08, three of the last four were English with Manchester United beating Barcelona en route to the trophy, in 2008-09 once again there were three English team semi-finals but Barcelona got the better of Manchester United this time.  Since then the English teams have not reached the same heights. Roberto di Matteo’s Chelsea’s win in 2011-12 was fortuitous. An inspired Didier Drogba’s flicked header in the dying moments of the final took the game to extra time and eventually penalties. If any Premier League team deserved to win before Liverpool did last year was it was Liverpool the previous year. But serial winners Real Madrid were too street smart for the European novices, so to speak. Within minutes of the game’s start in Madrid, their captain Sergio Ramos incapacitated Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah and the most successful English team in Europe never really recovered.  For all its popularity the world over, the English brand of football is quite different. There is a lot of huffing and puffing and players often run around like headless chickens. Players foul opponents nonchalantly. Fans bray for blood and crunchy tackles are cheered. Roman gladiators were probably cheered the same way two millennia ago. Entertainment there is aplenty. Fans would rather have their players sweat it out for the full 90 minutes rather than come up with moments of inspiration to turn the game around. Creative players like David Silva, Kevin de Bryune and Mesut Ozil in his pomp are few and far in between. Compare that with, say, a partially filled Italian stadium where the game is much more sedate and tactical, opponents are given space, teams wait for their chances to pounce and goals are much cleaner.

104,In Nepali boxing the fight is not in the ring and the sport suffers,"August 18, 2020","Nepal Boxing Association's (NBA) infighting has surfaced once again as some influential office bearers have made claims of financial irregularities and power abuse by the body’s president. General Secretary Sabin Bhattachary and Treasurer Gautam Sujakhu have accused President Ram Awale of acting against the spirit of the law and called him “an incapable person” to lead the body.  The fight between the two sides started in 2018 but resurfaced last week after President Awale produced a financial report during the executive committee meeting on July 30 and asked Sujakhu to sign it. ""The president wanted us (me and the treasurer) to endorse the financial report that he produced in the meeting. But we are not aware of any transactions in the NBA and we are not consulted in any affairs. So I proposed to him that he give me the details of transactions and a few days' time so that I get time to study it before I sign,” said general secretary Bhattacharya. “But he said the majority of the executive committee had already endorsed it so why did I need to study it.""  Sujakhu not only rejected the president's proposal but also asked him to reinstate him as the executive treasurer and produce him the details of financial transactions. The report had been endorsed by a majority of the 25-member executive committee although general secretary Bhattacharya had walked out of the meeting after he was verbally abused by the president’s supporters and was not allowed to express his discontent.  Sujakhu and Bhattacharya have complained to the National Sports Council and the Ministry of Youth and Sports appealing them not to endorse the financial report that has been submitted without the signature of treasurer and also to check into irregularities at the NBA. The dispute between the two sides goes back to August 2018 when President Awale appointed Ram Giri, an executive committee member, as acting treasurer at NBA.  “The president had wanted me to release funds for the Nepali boxers' training in Thailand. But the executive committee had made a decision that the funds could be released only after approval from the committee. I asked him to get the approval,” said Sujakhu.  Instead Awale appointed acting treasurer Ram Giri, a member of the executive committee.  “There is no provision of acting treasurer, but backed by the executive committee the president took the consent of the National Sports Council leadership to one,” said Sujakhu.  The president used a provision in the statute which gives him the authority to take steps to resolve any unforeseen circumstances in the operation of the NBA and appointed an acting treasurer. “Sujakhu refused to sign cheques despite repeated requests and at that time we were preparing for the 2018 Asian Games. I had no choice but to appoint Giri as the acting treasurer with consent from the National Sports Council,” Awale said. The Association has not held a single annual general assembly, as mandated by its statute, in the four years since the committee was elected in June 2016. In the last two years, 24 new district associations have been formed — 14 with approval from the president and 10 from general secretary — taking the total number of district associations to 50.  According to Bhattacharya, of the 24 new district associations, fewer than a dozen are active. But the district association was given approval for the sake of getting support from them during elections for the executive committee. ""Of the 14 district associations endorsed by the president, only four are active. In the capacity of general secretary, I have also endorsed 10 district associations and four of them are not active. If the President approves new district associations for election purposes then why can't I?"" said Bhattacharya. ""I have proposed that only active district associations be given membership. I can assure you that I won't be fighting for the presidency in the next election."" The NBA should have held its election in June this year, as the four year tenure of present executive has expired. But the election has been postponed, owing to the global coronavirus pandemic. The president, a businessman and a former boxer, blames Bhattacharya and Sujakhu, also former boxers, as the persons responsible for not letting the NBA conduct the annual general assembly. When asked how, he could not give a satisfactory answer.  ""There are a lot of sports associations in the country which do not hold their annual general assemblies. Now I understand why they do not. It is because a few people with wrong motives do not let it happen,"" Awale said.  Bhattacharya denies the allegations and instead blames the president for not letting the NBA conduct its general assembly.  ""I had even proposed to hold a general assembly at an executive committee meeting in early 2018. But the president feared that he would face a no-confidence motion and therefore he was uninterested,” said Bhattacharya. “The executive committee had sought clarification from him in December 2017. If the president says he could not hold a general assembly because of someone else, it raises a big question mark regarding his ability."" With this infighting within the Nepal Boxing Association, the game suffers.  “When the commander fights, it will definitely hamper the whole team. In fact, Nepali boxers are going to suffer due to this rift within the association,” said Prachanda Sharma, former head coach at NBA. “Under Awale's leadership, the NBA has not organised a single tournament under its banner. It is very disappointing for Nepali boxing.” Not only coaches but also boxing administrators are worried about the sport’s development.

105,Looking forward to Leeds United,"August 15, 2020","Legend has it that Marcelo Biesla, then coaching at the Argentine club Newell’s Old Boys, recruited young Mauricio Pochettino on the evidence of the size of his thighs seeing him sleeping. He had arrived at the young kid’s home late and did not want to wake him up. Before Pep Guaridola began his managerial career he went to meet Biesla to pick his brains and later called him “the best coach in the world”. When Leeds United representatives approached him before the 2018-19 season began, he flummoxed them with a tactical analysis of every team of the Championship. He is El Loco, or the crazy one. In August 2015 he quit Marseille after a game into the season saying he had not been supported in the transfer window, having already managed the team one full season. Next year, he quit Lazio two days after signing as the manager and even before the season began again for the lack of support. The year after that Lille sacked him after 13 games in-charge with the team second from bottom following disagreements with the club.  Leeds United players were initiated into his exacting ways early on. Training sessions were grueling, and sometimes there were two a day. He demands that players are on the move all the time playing in a 3-3-3-1 system with seven players attacking and nine defending while he watches from the sidelines sitting on a ‘plastic bucket’ with height of his specification because that is where he gets the best view of the game. The exhaustion the continuous movement entailed had its say in Biesla’s first year. They had been neck in neck with Norwich at the top throughout the season. However, the 46-game league was too much to take with the Biesla brand of football. Having lost the automatic promotion places, Leeds played in the playoffs and lost to Derby County in the semi final.   But the fans had been won over. A mid-table Championship team, Leeds United had seen glory days in the Premier League era. In the 2000-01 season they reached the semi-final of the Champions League, beating Real Madrid on the way. While in the Premier League from 1992 to 2004 they routinely competed for European places. The gamble for riches Europe promised, signing players beyond their reach, however, proved to be their undoing. They were relegated to the Championship, slid further down to League One in 2007, went bankrupt, changed ownership three times, lost in the play off fincal in 2016-17 before the arrival of the maverick.  Two off the pitch incidents in Biesla’s first season stand out. He made his players humbly pick litter around the training ground to make players understand the work fans put in to earn enough to watch them play. The other was Biesla sending a member of the coaching staff, equipped with binoculars, to spy on Derby County’s training session. Hell broke loose. Leeds were fined 200,000 pounds. Biesla never denied the accusation and paid the fine from his own pocket. True to form, the crazy one, instead, in his next press conference, which lasted two hours, expounded on the tactics of every opponent as if to say, “I don’t need to spy. I know all I need to know anyway.”  Biesla’s second season was more of the same as his first, competing with West Bromwich Albion, the recent arrival from the Premier League, and armed with parachute payments, for the top spot throughout the season. Fortunately, there was no repeat of the first season. Some say had it not been for the pandemic break, the team would have unravelled again. But we will never know. Leeds United, the team with a fan base that competes with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester United in English football, won the Championship trophy and are back in Premier League after 16 long years. And a philosopher of the game leads it. ",Sports,https://kathmandupost.com/premier-league-watch/2020/08/15/looking-forward-to-leeds-united

109,An aside: The FA Cup final,"August 8, 2020","Hector Bellerin rampaged down the middle of the pitch stating from the wrong side of the centre circle. He soon left behind the already booked Mateo Kovacic and the shaky central defender Antonio Rudiger. When Christensen tackled him near the penalty box the ball ricocheted to record signing Nicolas Pepe on the right who in turn rolled to ever-reliable PierreEmerick Aubameyang. The third of the back three defenders Kurt Zouma tried to stop the smiling assassin from shooting with his stronger right foot. In a twitch of the hip, that would make a Bollywood dancer proud, the Gabonese had the ball on his left leaving the Frenchman floundering. Willy Caballero, the 38-year old goalkeeper, rushed forward, the goal machine coolly chipped with his weaker foot. The net ruffled. It was a goal of beauty and one to remember for the ages.  This column is dedicated to the Premier League but I have taken the liberty to digress. The league is over and more than a month remains for the new season to begin. Two Premier League powerhouses were playing the final of the world’s oldest football tournament in an empty 90,000 capacity Wembley Stadium, the spiritual home of the game. This was the third meeting between Arsenal and Chelsea in the FA Cup this century. In 2002 Arsenal were in the ascendency when English football was in love with their manager, the professorial Arsene Wenger. In 2017, Arsenal had been long in decline and the beloved manager was being hounded. Both times Arsenal prevailed. This year’s FA Cup final was significant for at least two other reasons. Last year Chelsea had won the Europa League final in a canter against Arsenal. Chelsea had already booked their place in the Champions League but it was Arsenal’s final shot at a place in it if they beat Chelsea. Arsenal’s loss was the unravelling of Unai Emery’s brief (by Arsenal standards) reign. Therefore this was a chance for redemption for Arsenal. This year Chelsea had again already booked their place in the Champions League securing fourth position in the Premier League while Arsenal had missed out completely on European places coming lowly eighth, their worst position in 25 years. Win the FA Cup and they would be in the Europa League.  The second reason was this was the battle of the rookie managers – Frank Lampard and Mikel Arteta. Both are young and a have point to prove. While Lampard had been in charge at Derby County in the Championship last season, Mikel Arteta had deputised under the formidable Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Lampard’s Chelsea, with promising young guns, had done rather well despite being erratic at times, while Arteta since his arrival in December had been more concerned with structure and building a resolve in a team known to have a soft belly for more than a decade. They were, so to speak, still finding their feet in the top flight but being at Wembley was already feather in their caps. In the semi-final Lampard beat Manchester United, who had thumped them 4-0 earlier in the season, while Arteta beat his former City side.  With both defences suspect, goals were expected but this also meant a potentially cagey game with neither team willing to be bold going forward. But a wonderfully well-worked fifth minute goal from Captain America Christian Pulisic ruled out the second possibility. With the goal began Arsenal’s gradual ascendancy, exploiting the slow Chelsea defence with long balls into space left behind by their wingbacks and the equaliser came when captain Cesar Azpilicueta pulled down his counterpart swift Pierre Emerick Aubameyang in the penalty box. Injuries to Azpilicueta and goal scorer Pulisic weakened Chelsea. Worse, they were hard done by with two soft yellow cards for midfielder Mateo Kovacic, the second one in the 73rd minute.

110,It has been Liverpool's year,"August 2, 2020","For Liverpool Football Club fans since watching grainy pictures of the team play in their heydays in the 1980s on Doordarshan, since the Miracle of Istanbul in 2005 when they beat the then mighty AC Milan in the Champions League final after being 3-nil down at half-time, since the almost year of 2013-14 but for the painful Steven Gerrard slip, since the arrival of the charismatic straight-talking Jurgen Klopp in 2015 with his gegenpress and direct, relentless brand of football or since whenever for whatever reason, this truly has been a long time coming. Thirty exact years they have waited for this moment. Finally, their team have their hands on the elusive English top division trophy. It should have been theirs last year but for the relentless Manchester City march forward towards the end of the season not dropping a single point for more than a dozen games. Liverpool accumulated 97 points but still came second. That was a record point tally for a second placed team. City was ahead by a whisker with 98 points.  This year there were no problems whatsoever. The title fight was between Liverpool and holders Manchester City. Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal, did not matter as they were beset with internal grumblings or had new managers and were therefore going through a transition. Manchester City surrendered early on losing to newly-promoted Norwich. And when their number one central defender Aymeric Laporte got injured they just kept conceding goals. With one game for the season to go City have lost an unbelievable nine games, one more than 10th placed Arsenal.  Liverpool, meanwhile, never wobbled but marched imperiously. It was only a matter of how soon they would be champions with the small matter of matching Arsenal's 2004/2005 Invincibles of winning the title without losing a single game and matching or bettering Manchester City’s (again, the needling rivals) tally of 100 points. Both seemed achievable for such was their pomp. Alas, real-life stories don't always go according to plan. An Ismail Sarr inspired Watford, which seems headed to the Championship, to crush the dreams of his Senegal captain Sadio Mane by beating Liverpool 3-0 in January. As for the other record it became impossible after they were beaten by lowly Arsenal coached by Mikel Arteta, formerly the understudy of City's Pep Guardiola, in July. Even a Hollywood scriptwriter could not have scripted it better. Bloody football.  But that is not to take anything away from the achievement of Liverpool Football Club. The sheer beauty of their play this season has been simply breathtaking. From the long ball from bearded Allison to talismanic Salah run and boom, to the diagonal from left back Robertson to right back Alexander-Arnold control and boom, to false number nine Frimino's movement making space for often underappreciated Mane volley and boom, the three rotating midfielders' incredible work rate, to the majestic van Dijk at the back keeping an eye on his wards while moonlighting as a defender – it was like listening an orchestra with your eyes.  It almost happened with an asterix. The Premier League had to be suspended in the face of a harrowing pandemic and its resumption was uncertain. Manchester City, the only team that could have possibly caught up with Liverpool, was ready to concede the title if games did not restart. Liverpool would have won the league but with a footnote.",Sports,https://kathmandupost.com/premier-league-watch/2020/08/02/it-has-been-liverpool-s-year
111,Nepal’s home fixtures still uncertain due to coronavirus fears,"August 2, 2020","Nepal's revised fixtures for the Asian qualifiers of FIFA World Cup 2022 and AFC Asian Cup 2023, postponed due to Covid-19 pandemic, are still uncertain although the Asain Football Confederation has published the revised fixtures dates. Nepal are set to play the remaining three home matches of Group B against Chinese Taipei, Australia and Jordan by November 12 with the first on October 8. But the FIFA and AFC will finalise the matches only after assessment of the home country’s situation, according Indraman Tuladhar, general secretary of the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA)..  ""Our responsibility is to update them about the situation of Covid-19 in the country. It is up to them to decide if the matches will take place on the revised dates or not. But it has already been postponed for a long time and they are in a hurry to hold the games,"" said Tuladhar. Had the matches take place as per the original fixture dates Nepal should have played those three remaining matches by June 9.  ""We will follow all the safety regulations and guidelines set by FIFA and AFC. But If FIFA and AFC conclude that the situation is not favourable to host the event in Nepal then fixtures will be further postponed,"" added Tuladhar.  Though shifting matches to neutral venues could be an option, Tuladhar sees very slim chances of it. “Other countries are also equally affected by the pandemic, so I don’t think the matches would be shifted to neutral venues,” he said. Apart from Chinese Taipei, Australia and Jordan, the five team group also consists of Kuwait. Nepal played their first four matches of the qualifiers at away venues due to unavailability of a stadium that met international standards. The only international stadium – Dasharath Stadium was undergoing renovation after the April 2015 earthquake and also for the South Asian Games held in December last year.  Nepal had to play their home match against Kuwait on November 19 last year at a neutral venue in Thimphu, Bhutan after the AFC inspection team adjudged under-renovation stadium unfit to host the international games.  National team’s key member Sujal Shrestha believes that playing at home ground makes a big difference. ""Playing at home ground and familiar conditions is always an advantage. It makes home team players mentally strong and playing in front of home supporters adds to the strength of the team,"" said Shrestha who plays as a winger in 'A' Division League winners Machhindra Club. Meanwhile, ANFA have called 34 players for the preliminary selection of the national squad in preparation for the remaining qualifiers. All but one have reported to the camp.  ""The players belonging to departmental teams (Police, Army and Armed Police Force) and those who have their house or rented rooms in Kathmandu have been asked to self-quarantine. ANFA will arrange for quarantine at hotels for eight players who do not have rooms in Kathmandu,” said national team manager Madhu Sudhan Upadhyaya. ANFA have announced the start of the national team training from August 17.  In preparation, it is planning to conduct PCR tests of all 34 players, coaches and other staff to be involved during the training. “We are in consultation with doctors and they have suggested us to keep players in separate quarantine rather than single quarantine in the initial phase,” said Upadhyaya. “The PCR test will be conducted by August 8 of late and the players will be kept together at ANFA hostel after the results of the test.”  Despite the plans to start training after two weeks, national team head coach Johan Kalin is still at his home country Sweden. “As of now, his return to Nepal is uncertain, because the Swedish government has imposed travel restrictions to Nepal. We are in touch with him and he will return once the travel restriction is lifted by Sweden.His deputy Kiran Shrestha and goalkeeping coach Bikash Malla will conduct training in his absence,” said Upadhyaya.  Nepal have lost 7-0 to Kuwait, 5-0 to Australia and 3-0 to Jordan in their away matches before beating Chinese Taipei 2-0 in their second match of the campaign. In Nepal's home match played at a neutral venue in Thimphu they were defeated 1-0 by Kuwait. Australia occupy top spot in the group with 12 points winning all four matches while Nepal are fourth in the five team group with three points.  The double round-robin qualifiers are being played on home and away format. As per the new fixture dates, Nepal are set to host Chinese Taipei on October 8, Australia on October 13 and Jordan on November 12.

112,The season is finally over,"August 1, 2020","Liverpool’s first Premier League crown was not the only story of this difficult season. The fight for European places, the relegation battle and other smaller dramas within individual teams made up the season. The newly promoted teams had to prove that they belonged. For cash strapped teams like Brighton, avoiding relegation would be a victory.  Despite their flying start, the relegation of Norwich was looking likely as early as January. They had won the Championship but they soon seemed out of their depth in this league. Newly-promoted Aston Villa seemed likely to join them until the very last two games. In their penultimate game they beat Arsenal 1-0. Depending on Watford’s result against (again) Arsenal on the last day they could stay up. Watford lost and Prince William’s team Aston Villa survived. But Sheffield United, returning the Premier League after 12 years, were a different story altogether.  Before the pandemic disruption, Sheffield United with its very English brand of football of tireless running, high pressing and physicality were Champions League hopefuls. But the break broke their momentum. They ended up ninth but won many hearts on the way. The last time they were in the Premier League they had lasted just a season and pundits had expected a repeat.  Bournemouth, the second team to get relegated, had been punching above its weight since its promotion to the Premier League in 2015/16 season. Such was the admiration for their young manager Eddie Howe he was touted as a future England manager. But injuries and key decisions against them aided by the controversial VAR sent them down.  Watford, who played in the FA Cup final last season, had survived in the Premier League five seasons. But this season it saw a managerial merry-go-round with the first one sacked after four games and the third one when two games of the season were remaining. Before Arsenal Manchester thrashed them.  At the other end of the table Brendon Rodgers was doing wonders for Leicester till the break. They were third in the league and a Champion League place seemed assured. But injury to playmaker James Madisson towards the end, general tiredness and a limited squad did them in. On the last day they had to beat Manchester United but the superpower prevailed. With a new manager, and little investment in players no one really expected Leicester to go to the Europa League but they have.  FIFA had imposed a transfer ban on Chelsea when the season began (later overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sports) so there were no new players except Christian Pulisic who they had signed the previous season and loaned back to Borussia Dortmund. Their best player Eden Hazard had left for greener pastures. And they had a rookie manager in club legend Frank Lampard. It was a stop start season but somehow they held on to the fourth Champions League spot.  Wolverhampton Wanderers continued to impress despite a poor start with the toils of Europa League qualification rounds early on. But soon with their well-drilled direct football they began accumulating points and even looked like they would qualify for the Champions League. But they too floundered after the restart. They are still in the Europa League and could win and play in the elite European club tournament.  New manager Steve Bruce’s Newcastle were not expected to do as well as they did but ensured safety even before the restart. Southampton picked itself up admirably after Leicester humiliated it 7-0 and went on a winless streak looking down the barrel of the gun. Roy Hogdson’s calm influence continued to steady Crystal Palace and Sean Dyche’s physical Burnley continued to punch above its weight. Graham Potter’s Brighton went on with their job quietly and were never really in the relegation scrap like Chris Houghton’s was last year.

But the June match against Jordan may be organised on a mutual understanding after analysing the situations,"" ANFA General Secretary, Indra Man Tuladhar said.  Previously, Nepal lost 7-0 against Kuwait in the away leg and 1-0 in the home leg played in Bhutan after the Dashrath Stadium was adjudged unfit to host the game for failing to meet the international standards set by the technical committee of AFC. Nepal had gone down 5-0 against Australia and 3-0 against Jordan in their away matches before defeating Taiwan 2-0, away from home.

118,Nepal's Asia Cup Qualifiers dream sours despite a comprehensive win ,"March 4, 2020","Nepal's ambitions of qualifying for the Asia Cup Qualifiers was dealt a hammer blow, despite their thumping nine-wicket win over the hosts Thailand in their penultimate match of the ACC Eastern Region Twenty20 Qualifiers in Bangkok on Wednesday. Nepal, who pulled off their first win in the third match of the campaign, saw their qualification hopes evaporating after Singapore defeated Hong Kong to register their third win from as many matches. With the win, Singapore also sealed their place for the Asia Cup Qualifiers, with six points. The Asia Cup Qualifiers will be held in August, in Malaysia. As the tournament offers two top teams place for the Asia Cup Qualifiers, the winners between Hong Kong and Malaysia, both of which have four points each, will qualify for the final. Had Hong Kong defeated Singapore, Nepal could still remain in the hunt for a second place. Nepal now lie fourth on the table with two points after one win and two defeats. On Wednesday's match played at Terdthai Cricket Ground in Bangkok, Nepal bundled out Thailand for 66 runs before completing the chase in just their sixth over. Winning the toss and deciding to bat, Thailand's woeful campaign continued and they struggled against the Nepali bowlers. Opener Naveed Pathan was caught for eight in the second over, which triggered Thailand’s downfall. Daniel Jacobs played 10 balls but failed to open his account as he was run out in the third over. Henno Jordan and Phiriyapong Suanchuai were the top scorers and the only two batsmen to reach double digit scores with 13 runs each. Thailand’s score would have been even lower had Nepal not given away 17 runs in extras, including eight wide deliveries. Thailand finished their campaign with four losses and a highest total of 96 runs. Karan KC took three wickets giving away just 12 runs in his four overs. Avinash Bohora had two and Bhuwan Karki and Sandeep Lamichhane took one each. Almost every bowler had healthy bowling figures. Karki conceded six but the one who stood out was of Lamichhane. The spinner bowled 22 dot balls in his 24 deliveries. Chasing the modest Thailand total, Nepal lost Paras Khadka for nine in just the second over. Khadka was stumped off a Nopphon Senamontree's delivery. Opener Kushal Malla blasted 36 from 18 deliveries and Pawan Sharraf made a quickfire 27 from 10 balls, as Nepal finished the game by attaining the required 72 runs score from only 33 balls.

However, Nepal set some new records in the game. • 22 dot balls: Spinner Sandeep Lamichhane had just one wicket to his name in the match. But he bowled 22 dot balls from his 24 deliveries. He becomes the first Nepali bowler to have that many dot balls in a single innings by Nepali bowler in T20 international match. He also recently became the first Nepali bowler to take 100 T20 wickets. • 87 balls to spare: Chasing 67 runs for victory, Nepal raced towards victory from just 33 balls.

123,Cluster infections cause cases to soar in Valley despite restrictions,"September 4, 2020","Maiya Sainju is the in-charge of urban health clinic at the office of Ward No. 32 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, she has been assigned the duty of contact tracing, which entails informing the infected people about their infection, enquiring about the family members and others who came in their close contacts, checking the facilities for the infected people to stay in home isolation, and taking updates on their health. But with cases rising, Sainju has not been going out these days for the fear of getting exposed to the virus. Like Sainju, most of the health workers deputed for contact tracing are doing their job over the phone.  “Due to the infection risk, we have stopped meeting the infected people and others,” Sainju told the Post. “Our office [urban health division under the metropolitan city] has asked us to try to contact people by phone.” Public health experts say the health workers’ concerns are understandable but since contact tracing involves so many things, it is not possible just by phone. Contact tracing is the key to breaking the virus transmission chain and doctors have for long argued that the prohibitory period should have been used to ramp up efforts to ensure effective contact tracing. Even after two weeks of prohibitory orders, the virus spread has shown no signs of slowing.  On Thursday, 445 people tested positive in the Kathmandu Valley–357 in Kathmandu, 46 in Lalitpur and 42 in Bhaktapur. The number of new cases stood at 200 on August 20, when the prohibitory orders first came into force in the Valley.  As of Thursday, the number of cases in the Valley reached 7,038 with 4,540 of them detected after the prohibitory orders were announced on August 19 midnight.  Across the country the tally stands at 42,877 with 1,228 reported in the last 24 hours.  “With prohibitory orders, authorities may have been able to prevent an explosion of infections, but there has been no decline in the number of new cases,” Dr Prabhat Adhikari, an infectious disease and critical care expert, told the Post. “There could be several loopholes, which need to be fixed at the earliest.” Doctors say new cases should have declined by now as two weeks is the upper limit for the incubation period of the coronavirus. The continuing rise in new cases shows that restrictions alone do not help contain the coronavirus spread. According to Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, the ongoing restrictions may have prevented community transmissions, but they have not stopped cluster transmissions. “People have not stopped meeting relatives, acquaintances, and visiting one another's homes,” Pun told the Post. “I like to call the ongoing transmission family transmission, as entire family members and their relatives are testing positive.” According to experts, if a person from a family has visited the disease-hit areas and s/he transmits the infection to other family members or to the extended family, it is cluster infections.  Inability to find the source of virus and apathy of the authorities to establish the source and break the chain of infection could be another reason why new cases are not declining.  According to an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, over 95 percent of the new cases being detected these days are local cases, whose source of infection could not be established.  “When sources cannot be established, contact tracing, testing and isolation becomes almost impossible,” said an official of the division requesting anonymity.  At a meeting of officials from the World health Organisation country office in Nepal, the European Union and the Health Ministry, the UN health agency stressed for coordination and unity among the government bodies fighting against the pandemic. Despite the rising number of cases, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has a limited number of people for contact tracing, according to Hari Kunwar, chief of the Urban Health Division of KMC.  Health workers deployed for contact tracing only contact people, whose number is provided by the infected. Sainju said that some infected people do not give information about the people whom they had close contacts with. But the number of people who want to be tested are high.  “Dozens of people from the area [where the infected lives] come to us and tell us that they too have met the infected and demand tests,” one health worker said, asking not to be named. “But we cannot recommend tests for all those who demand tests.” The government has even failed to make people aware about the risk of the infection. “People have either taken the risk too seriously or ignored the risks,” Dr Radhika Thapaliya, a risk communication expert, told the Post. “We should change the communication strategy and give tailored messages.” According to Thapaliya, in risk communication tailored messages mean giving a message as per the belief and circumstances of the people, which can help improve behavioral outcomes. On Thursday, hundreds of youths defied prohibitory orders and pulled the Machhindranath chariot in Lalitpur without heed to the risk of infection. “We too are surprised over the rise in new cases even after two weeks of restrictions,” Dr Roshan Pokhrel, chief specialist at the Health Ministry, told the Post.

125,"As Covid-19 affects healthcare workers, non-Covid patients left in limbo","September 3, 2020","All services, except for emergency ones, have remained shut for the last two days at Bir Hospital, Kathmandu, after 71 health workers, including over two dozen doctors, tested positive for Covid-19. Bir, the only the non-Covid public hospital in the Kathmandu Valley, provides patients most of the medical services available in the country. Due to its shutdown, hundreds of ailing people are being deprived of treatment for non-Covid ailments.  Similarly, 31 doctors have been infected with the disease at the National Trauma Center.  According to the Ministry of Health and Population, while around 800 health workers across the country have tested positive for coronavirus, one has died due to Covid-19. Among the infected health workers, more than 200 are doctors. With so many health workers infected, treatment for non-Covid ailments has been stalled at many health facilities. Public health experts say that rising infections among health care workers is alarming as it signals a shortage of healthcare workers to treat not only patients infected with coronavirus, but also other ailments. They have called on the government to provide better protection for health workers so that they can treat non-Covid patients as well. “Over 2,500 patients used to visit the out-patient department of our hospital for services at this time,” Dr Rohit Kumar Pokhrel, director at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, another public hospital in the Valley, told the Post. “But only around 150 patients come these days.”  The number of patients seeking emergency services at the hospital has also declined drastically. On a normal day, 500 patients sought emergency services at the hospital, but the number is now down to around 50, mainly due to the lockdown, hospital officials said. But even with the dwindling number of patients, hospitals and healthcare facilities across the country are faced with shortages of health workers. “If we fail to pay attention to the growing infection rate among healthcare workers, we will face a critical shortage of health workers to treat both Covid and non-Covid patients,” Dr Dipendra Pandey, former chairman of Government Doctors’ Association of Nepal, told the Post. The apathy of the government to provide personal protective equipment, face shields, masks, gloves and others are considered the main reasons for growth in infections among healthcare workers. It’s not just the private hospitals, even state-run health facilities haven’t provided adequate safety gear to frontline workers, experts say. Health workers have complained that they are compelled to use the same masks for over a week and even reuse disposable masks after washing. While paying attention to Covid-19, authorities concerned have forgotten about thousands of non-covid patients, who need medication, but have been unable to to reach the hospital, doctors say. “People suffering from renal failure need dialysis at least twice a week. They are facing a lot of challenges,” said Dr JP Agrawal, former dean at the Institute of Medicine. “Dialysis centers seek polymerase chain reaction test reports for services and to undergo the test twice a week is impossible.” Similarly, thousands of patients suffering from chronic ailments—asthma, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, thyroid and others, who need regular follow up checks are also being deprived of medical consultations.  “Chronic patients need to undergo regular tests, medicine used by them needs to be changed now and then,” Dr Bhim Acharya, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, told the Post. “Such patients can die if not monitored their health regularly by their physicians.” The national Covid-19 tally on Tuesday reached 41,649 with 251 deaths.  The Ministry of Health said that 1,120 people tested positive, and 12 died, in the last 24 hours. The number of positive cases in the Kathmandu Valley has reached 6,593. Meanwhile, even doctors who got infected while deployed at the Covid-19 frontline are not getting proper treatment. According to the Nepal Medical Association, a doctor, serving at Birat Medical College in Birgunj, infected with Covid-19 is in a critical condition, but is not getting an intensive care unit bed in the city. “‘We are trying to bring the doctor to Kathmandu,” Dr Lochan Karki, chairman of Nepal Medical Association, an umbrella organization of medical doctors, told the Post.  “Overlooking the growing infection rate among health care workers could be costly for the country. To treat both Covid or non-Covid patients, health workers are needed, we should understand this fact, and implement more stringent measures to protect them.”",Health,https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/09/03/as-covid-19-affects-healthcare-workers-non-covid-patients-left-in-limbo

128,"Current efforts to slow the virus not working, time to start antibody tests, doctors say","August 31, 2020","The restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus spread do not seem to have worked well, if the infection rates–across the country and Kathmandu Valley–are anything to go by. The national Covid-19 tally on Monday reached 39,460, with 228 deaths.  The Health Ministry said that 899 people tested positive, with seven deaths, in the last 24 hours. Kathmandu Valley recorded 298 new cases on Monday, taking the tally to 5,724. The government has been relying on lockdowns and prohibitory orders to contain the virus spread. However, health experts have long argued that blanket restrictions are not a solution to the pandemic. They say the decisions–to impose the lockdown on March 24 and then completely lift it after four months without giving a proper thought–were wrong. What then the authorities could have done? Apart from testing, tracing and treating, the government should have resorted to seroprevalence surveys, doctors say. According to them, seroprevalence surveys can provide data on the prevalence of the virus in communities, thereby helping the authorities locate hotspots and take various necessary measures accordingly.  “Had such a survey been carried out in some Tarai districts, especially Parsa, Morang, and Dhanusha, we could have known the prevalence of the virus,” an official at the Department of Health Services, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Post. “Concerned authorities then could have restricted movements to and from the areas where the cases were high. It could have helped break the transmission chain to a large extent, preventing the virus taking hold in society.” A serology test examines the presence of antibodies. When a human body is exposed to a foreign pathogen, it produces antibodies in response.  Serology tests look for either Immunoglobulin M (IgM) or Immunoglobulin G (IgG), the two antibodies developed by the body against the virus. The IgM is the first antibody developed by the immune system, so it is detected during the test first, within a week or two, followed by the IgG, which is detected during another test two weeks after the infection.  A seroprevalence survey can provide an estimation on the percentage of people in a population with antibodies against SARS-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19. This then can tell authorities how many people in a specific population may have previously contracted the virus.  After the end of the lockdown on July 21, the Health Ministry said it would perform seroprevalence surveys on around 7,500 people. The authorities, however, have yet to conduct the survey.  “We had entrusted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division with the task of performing serology tests about a month ago,” Dr Sameer Kumar Adhikari, joint spokesperson for the Health Ministry, told the Post.  Division officials, however, said since they are already hamstrung by manpower crunch, they sought help from the World Health Organization’s country office in Nepal to provide technical staff to conduct the tests. “We sought the WHO help for technical staff, as it takes a longer time to hire staff from our system,” Dr Basudev Pandey, director at the Division, told the Post, pointing at the byzantine bureaucratic process the government hiring takes. “The UN agency has set the September 4 deadline for applications. We can start the study once we are provided with the staff.” Doctors and public health experts say a lack of political will from the authorities is largely to blame for the poor response to the pandemic and that the delay in conducting the seroprevalence survey is just an example how government officials are refusing to recognise a looming catastrophe. According to them, existing human resources serving in health facilities could have been easily deployed for the survey.  Dr Prbhat Adhikari, an infectious disease and critical care expert, said nurses and paramedics can be roped in for the initial process, in which they just need to draw blood from patients and store it properly. The samples then need to be sent to laboratories, where the presence of antibodies–IgG and IgM–can be detected in blood plasma. While the IgM usually disappears from the blood within a few months after recovery, the IgG can be detected for years.  Two types of tests—an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, also called ELISA and Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) test–are performed to check the antibody against Covid-19 on participants. Both tests are considered a gold standard for study of antibodies against the coronavirus, according to Dr Megnath Dhimal, chief researcher at Nepal Health Research Council. “Seroprevalence tests help us identify the risk and contain the spread of infection,” said Dhimal. “Such studies help us locate high risk areas so that the authorities can declare restrictions on those areas and perform polymerase chain reaction tests.” The United Nations in Nepal in its April report “Covid-19 Nepal: Preparedness and Response Plan” had listed “strengthening capacity and partnerships for operations research–transmission studies and sero-surveys” as one of the priority preparedness activities. As one of the priority response activities, the UN called for facilitating lab-based operations research–especially in determining household infection rates, asymptomatic infection rates and seroprevalence. Even after spending billions–Rs13 billion by the government’s own admission–authorities now appear to be groping in the dark. Although public health experts have been saying that there is enough evidence to prove community spread of the virus, government officials continue to deny this.  “A seroprevalence study can also be helpful in confirming the community spread,” said Dr Kiran Pandey, a consultant physician at Hams Hospital. “This is one of the ways to perform more focussed tests and pool testing in risk areas, thereby saving resources.” In pool testing, samples from multiple people are tested on the whole batch. If a pool returns a positive result, the second phase of testing is conducted by breaking down the batch into small groups to identify the infected person or people.  If it shows negative, all individuals in the batch are negative. In an interview with the New York Times in June, Dr Anthony S Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said US officials were having “intense discussions” about a possible shift to “pool testing”. “The standard approach to controlling infectious diseases–testing sick people, isolating them and tracing their contacts–was not working,” he said. “The failure was in part because some infected Americans are asymptomatic and unknowingly spreading the virus but also because some people exposed to the virus are reluctant to self-quarantine or have no place to do so.” The threat level in Nepal may not have reached the US level yet, but what the doctor says does resonate with the situation here–infected asymptomatic people might be spreading the virus and some despite getting exposed to the virus are either not going into self-isolation or lack facilities at home to do so.",Health,https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/08/31/current-efforts-to-slow-the-virus-not-working-time-to-start-antibody-tests-doctors-say

130,Serology test in the context of Covid-19,"August 31, 2020","Nepal’s Covid-19 tally on Sunday reached 38,561, with 1,221 new cases in the last 24 hours. With 14 more fatalities, the coronavirus death toll has soared to 221. Kathmandu Valley reported a record 429 new infections, with 372 cases in Kathmandu district, 45 in Bhaktapur and 12 in Lalitpur, according to the Ministry of Health. As Covid-19 patients in need of critical care also continue to rise, infectious disease experts and doctors say there is growing evidence of community transmission of the virus. Epidemiologists say the only way to confirm or rule out community transmission is through expanded testing and it needn’t be polymerase chain reaction tests. Serology or antibody tests can also provide a perspective about the scale of transmission and help the government and public health agencies chart an effective Covid-19 strategy, they say. According to the World Health Organisation, serology tests would help investigate the ‘occurrence of infection in the population, how many people have mild or asymptomatic infection and who may not have been identified and the proportion of the population who may be protected against infection in the future’. Here’s everything you need to know about the serology test in the context of Covid-19: What is a serology test and why is it used? A serology test examines the liquid part of the blood to detect antibodies made by the immune system in response to a threat, such as SARS-CoV-2 which causes Covid-19.  The test looks for either Immunoglobulin M (IgM) or Immunoglobulin G (IgG), the two antibodies developed by the body against the virus. The IgM is the first antibody that is developed by the immune system so it is detected on the test first, within a week or two followed by the IgG, which is detected on tests two weeks after the infection. While the IgM usually disappears from the blood within a few months after recovery, the IgG can be detected for years.  How is the test performed and what do the results mean? A blood sample of a person is collected and sent to the laboratory for testing. A positive test would mean that the person was infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the past and their immune system developed antibodies as a defence mechanism. But in communities which have reported sporadic cases, experts say there is a higher chance that a positive test is a false positive. Similarly, in communities which have reported clusters of cases, there is a high chance that a positive test is a true positive. If a test returns negative results, it would mean that the person may not have contracted Covid-19 in the past, but there remains a possibility that the antibody test was conducted too soon to test positive. This is the reason a serology test is not used to diagnose an active Covid-19 case but to determine if there was a past infection. However, serology tests are both subject to sensitivity and specificity and may produce unreliable results while in some cases, tests could cross react with other coronaviruses that are not SARS-CoV-2, leading to false results. How is the serology test helpful in the context of Covid-19? Since a serology test can identify if a person had contracted Covid-19 in the past, regardless of the case being symptomatic or not, the presence of the IgM or IgG antibodies could help determine when the illness had occurred. A serology test at the community level could help the government and public health agencies understand what percentage of the population may have already contracted the disease. A serology test could also help identify individuals who qualify to donate convalescent plasma, which is currently being tested as a Covid-19 treatment. How can serology tests help the government and public agencies devise a strategy to break the chain of transmission?",Health,https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/08/31/serology-test-in-the-context-of-covid-19
131,"Ensure effective contact tracing and place symptomatic patients in hospitals, doctors say","August 30, 2020","A man from Gyankunja Tole of Bhaktapur Municipality died of Covid-19 on Sunday. He was 65. He was among the 14 people who succumbed to the coronavirus in the last 24 hours. The man, however, did not die in hospital. He had been in home isolation for the last six days. He had tested positive for the virus on August 25. The death during home isolation, according to doctors, puts spotlight on the concerns that have been raised for quite some time that many people might die without getting treatment. “Health workers deployed for contact tracing had tracked the infected man on August 27,” Shyam Krishna Khatri, chief of Ward No. 1 of Bhaktapur Municipality, told the Post. “Our health workers allowed the patient to stay in home isolation at the request of the family members.” He was said to have other underlying conditions as well–he was suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Ward chief Khatri conceded that even after tracking the patient, no one from the authorities reached his home to monitor his health condition. “We were unaware of his other health conditions,” said Khatri. “We were informed only after the patient’s death.” Even after the man was found to be infected, health workers deployed for contact tracing had not taken swab samples of the people who had come in close contact with the deceased.  Khatri said that there are five other people–three from the family and two who live on rent in the same house–who could have come in contact with the deceased.  Swab samples of the five people were collected only after the patient died.  Amid arguments that people in Nepal are dying of pre-existing and underlying health conditions rather than the coronavirus, doctors say there are now concerns if negligence and lack of facilities will kill more people than Covid-19. “It looks like instead of Covid-19, the man died due to the negligence of the authorities concerned,” Dr GD Thakur, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, told the Post. “The authorities’ responsibility is not over after they have tracked the infected people.” If the officials were to follow the protocol, after tracking an infected person, they have to assess if there is sufficient facility at the person’s home for self-isolation. They need to then ensure that health workers monitor the infected person’s health condition every day. An ambulance also needs to be ready, should the infected person’s health deteriorate.  Nepal on Sunday reported the highest number of deaths as well as highest new cases for a single day. The country’s Covid-19 infection tally has reached 38,561. The Health Ministry said on Sunday, 1,221 people tested positive for the virus in the last 24 hours, with 429 in Kathmandu Valley, both highest daily records till date. There are over 500 active cases in 11 districts, including Kathmandu and Lalitpur of the Valley. The Covid-19 death toll has reached 221.  With the cases rising at an alarming rate, health facilities are already getting overwhelmed, and the government has been encouraging people to practise self-isolation, which public health experts have for long warned could spell a disaster. According to the Ministry of Health, there were 6,906 people in home isolation on Sunday, with 1,950 in Bagmati Province, and most of them in Kathmandu Valley. Dr Sushil Nath Pyakurel, former director general of the Department of Health Services, said home isolation is not something that should not be practised, but the government should take into consideration multiple factors. “Allowing symptomatic Covid-19 patients to stay in home isolation is too risky, as many in the country may not have a separate room and separate bathrooms, which are necessary if a person is to be isolated,” said Pyakurel. “Keeping a serious patient at home, without considering the risk of transmission to family members is a blunder.” The major risk of home isolation is the entire family could easily get infected, according to him. “And this is how the virus easily spreads in the community,” said Pyakurel. Even as the cases are rising, the government authorities are not saying exactly what they are doing to contain the virus spread, except issuing prohibitory orders.  Over half of the 77 districts of the country, including Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhakatpur of the Valley, are currently under prohibitory orders, which mean a ban on public and vehicular movements as well as opening of shops and businesses. The government has refused to pay heed to public health experts’ calls that a prohibitory order or a lockdown is not a solution to the pandemic. Allowing essential services for limited hours creates more crowds, increasing the risk of the virus spread, according to them. The government recently made two decisions though–establishing five-bed hospitals in each local level and reducing the cost of PCR tests from Rs 5,500 to 4,400. Doctors say hospitals–big or small–are required, but building them from the scratch takes time, hence some existing ones should be converted into dedicated Covid-19 health facilities. Reducing PCR testing cost is a good move, but until effective contact tracing is ensured, cases will continue to rise, according to them.  According to Thakur, only asymptomatic infected people, who have separate facilities at home, can stay in home isolation.  “Authorities need to assess the facilities before allowing infected people to stay in home isolation,” said Thakur. “All symptomatic cases should be taken to institutional isolations and serious cases should be admitted to hospitals that have intensive care and ventilator facilities.” Dr Sameer Kumar Adhikari, joint spokesperson for the Health Ministry, however, said that he was not aware of Bhaktapur case.  “We have never said that an infected person having pre-existing medical conditions can be left at home,” Adhikari told the Post. “If the patient was allowed to stay at home despite his underlying health conditions, it was a mistake.” He said that he can inquire about the incident only on Monday. Public health experts say there continues to be a lack of communication, which is reflected in what the ministry official is saying. Even months into the pandemic, the government has not yet introduced a risk communication strategy. Public service announcements are few and far between.  Doctors say the three Ts–test, trace and treat–while are technical parts, the authorities should also ensure the fourth T–trust–in the fight against this pandemic. The government should be able to give a sense of security to the people so that they can trust the authorities. Setting up isolation facilities, increasing the number of intensive care unit beds and ventilators and informing the people about the preparations being made to save their lives are necessary, according to Pyakurel.  “The authorities must stop stressing home isolation,” Pyakurel told the Post. “Building community isolation centres, keeping ambulances on standby and ensuring isolation beds and ventilators to transfer patients if their health condition deteriorates are a must.” Currently, five ambulances of Nepal Ambulance Service are being used to transport Covid-19 patients to isolation facilities and hospitals.  According to Amit Joshi, chief executive officer of Nepal Ambulance Service, infected patients have to wait for hours for the ambulances to take them to the isolation facilities and hospitals.",Health,https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/08/30/ensure-effective-contact-tracing-and-place-symptomatic-patients-in-hospitals-doctors-say

135,Covid-19 is sickening and killing people of all age groups in Nepal,"August 27, 2020","On Thursday, Nepal reported eight more coronavirus deaths, taking the tally to 183. According to the Ministry of Health data, 88 of the victims are aged between 31 and 60 years. Of the 183 people who have lost their lives to the virus so far, 17 were aged 31-40; 42 were aged 41-50, and 29 were between 51 and 60 years of age. The rest were either above 60 or below 30 years of age. Though officials say 90 percent of those who died had pre-existing medical conditions, doctors say such a sweeping statement by those in authority could be costly for the country, as there is a need also to dig deeper into demography. According to public health experts, attributing Covid-19 deaths to pre-existing and underlying medical conditions is tantamount to refusing to recognise the real threat of the virus. “Youths and working class people have been infected and have died throughout the globe,” Dr Anup Bastola, spokesperson for the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, told the Post. “In our country also, the young population is getting infected and dying. Data shows that people who are in their highly productive age are dying. This can have long-term consequences.” Doctors agree that people with underlying and pre-existing conditions are at bigger risk of dying from Covid-19, but the authorities should step up measures to ensure swift treatment for patients rather than just counting the numbers. Chronic ailments like hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol and thyroid have been reported in Nepalis from their early 30s. Several studies, including the result of the STEPS survey on non-communicable disease risk factors, which is the population-based household survey of adults between 15 and 69 years carried out on 6,450 individuals, showed that 24.5 percent of the respondents (almost one in four) have high blood pressure. About nine percent of the respondents had high blood sugar levels. Eleven percent of the respondents said they have high cholesterol.  Results of another study—Burden of non-communicable disease in Nepal—published last year show that of the total national deaths, 12 percent were caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. “Death is not just about numbers,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease control Division. “The authorities need to try to save people from dying, rather than simply saying every other death was due to some pre-existing medical condition.” Ever since the first Covid-19 case was reported back in January, Nepali authorities have shown reluctance to recognise the threat. In the initial days, people in power, including the prime minister and ministers, peddled misinformation and made futile efforts to declare Nepal a coronavirus-free country. The first death was reported on May 14, a day after President Bidya Devi Bhandari addressed the nation defending the KP Oli administration’s “efforts” in the fight against the pandemic. When two deaths were confirmed, Prime Minister Oli was still reluctant to attribute them to Covid-19. While addressing Parliament, Oli said they had died of “some other reasons”. Public health experts and doctors have for long alleged that the government has defied science and ignored their suggestions as Covid-19 spread in the country. As of Thursday, according to the Ministry of Health, the country has reported 35, 529 Covid-19 cases across the country, with 1,111 new infections reported in the last 24 hours. As many as 377 new cases were reported in Kathmandu Valley, where the total number of coronavirus cases has reached 4,396.  Dr Madhu Devkota, a professor at the Tribhuvan University Institute of Medicine, said that people of all age groups are highly vulnerable to Covid-19. “What is worrying is while the infection and death rate among the elderly is rising, working class people are too highly exposed to the virus,” Devkota told the Post. “Working class people are more mobile than the elderly people.” In a bid to break the virus transmission chain, the Oli government has asked chief district officers to take measures, including prohibitory orders. Chief district officers of the Kathmandu Valley, who issued prohibitory orders effective August 19 midnight for a week, on Wednesday decided to extend the restrictions  until September 2 midnight. Public health experts and doctors, however, have been saying that just extendinng curbs won’t help fight the virus, as it has taken hold in society.  Devkota said that along with such measures, the authorities must focus on curative measures as well–isolation and treatment of the infected–to save lives.",Health,https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/08/27/covid-19-is-sickening-and-killing-people-of-all-age-groups-in-nepal

137,"Government directs private health institutions to set aside 1,000 beds for Covid patients, but they say it’s impossible","August 27, 2020","As the number of symptomatic coronavirus cases continues to grow, the government wants private hospitals to allocate upto 1,000 beds for Covid-19 patients. But private hospitals seem reluctant to do so.  As public hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients, the Ministry of Health and Population directed the Association of Private Health Institutions, Nepal, to set aside as many as 1,000 beds and 100 ICUs for virus patients.  The new directive from the government, which had earlier directed private institutions to allocate 20 percent of their total bed capacity for Covid cases, is impossible to implement, hospital operators say. “We can’t allocate beds and ICUs the government has asked for,” said Kumar Thapa, senior vice president at the Association of Private Health Institutions. “Representatives from the Ministry of Health have sought 1,000 beds and 100 ICU. But we can’t afford to provide all of what is being asked,” Thapa told the Post. “At best, we can manage up to 500 beds and 60 ICUs. We are making plans and will decide how to go about it soon. But managing 1,000 beds is impossible.” Sameer Adhikari, joint spokesperson for the ministry, said that pressure on public hospitals treating Covid-19 was getting “tighter”, and the ministry is discussing the prospect of admitting patients to private hospitals.  “We have already coordinated with certain hospitals such as Manmohan Hospital, KMC, NMC, Yeti Hospital, and Megha Hospital,” he said.",Health,https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/08/27/government-directs-private-health-institutions-to-set-aside-1-000-beds-for-covid-patients-but-they-say-it-s-impossible

139,Health workers say they reuse disposable masks as hospitals don’t provide enough,"August 26, 2020","Dipendra Pandey, a doctor at the National Trauma Center in Kathmandu, has been using the same disposable mask for over a week. His hospital does not give him masks every day while he attends to patients.  “I know that disposable masks cannot be reused or used even after washing, but I have no choice,” Pandey told the Post. “I had asked the hospital administration yesterday for masks, but they say they do not have any in stock.” Like at the Trauma Center, health workers serving in most hospitals—private, community and state-run—have said they are compelled to reuse disposable masks, face shields and other protective gear as they have not been provided sufficiently. Some doctors are requesting medical representatives who approach doctors to promote drugs their companies produce for masks. “They have not directly sought favours for providing masks, but everybody knows doctors too have to help them by prescribing drugs their companies manufacture,” a doctor at Bir Hospital told the Post on condition of anonymity. “Buying masks for personal use every day is not possible and using the same masks for several days is too risky. We are having a very hard time these days.” With a spike in cases and deaths from the coronavirus infections throughout the country, health workers deployed on the front lines are also getting infected at an alarming rate. According to data provided by the Ministry of Health and Population, over 500 health workers have tested positive for the coronavirus in the country and this accounts for more than 1.5 percent of the total positive cases. As of Tuesday, 33,533 people have tested positive, with 164 deaths. According to the Health Ministry, 855 people tested positive on Tuesday and seven died of Covid-19. Public health experts said that the rise in infection rate among health workers is worrisome. They blame the apathy of concerned agencies for providing them with safety gear like quality masks, face shields, personal protective equipment and gloves for the rise in infections among health workers. “This is a serious thing and health workers are compelled to reuse face masks even if that is very disturbing,” Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, told the Post. “How will we have health workers if all keep getting infected.” Most of the infected professionals are not among those that are exclusively treating Covid-19 patients but in hospitals that provide services to non-Covid patients. No health worker at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, which has been treating Covid-19 patients since the first coronavirus case was reported in the country in January, has been infected so far. Health workers treating Covid-19 patients in Patan Hospital, Armed Police Force Hospital and the Covid-19 unit of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital have also not been infected as of now, according to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health workers serving at the Covid-19 block at our hospital have not got infected but several others serving in other departments have tested positive,” Dr Subhash Prasad Acharya, head of the Department of Critical Care at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital told the Post. “This means, those serving in the Covid -19 blocks are getting safety equipment and taking precautions while others are not getting those gears or taking full precautions.” Health workers at almost all general hospitals—Bir Hospital, National Trauma Center, Police Hospital, Alka Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital, Kathmandu Medical College, Manmohan Hospital, Nepal Medical College, Grande International Hospital, and Vayodha Hospital—that have not treated Covid-19 patients have also tested positive for the coronavirus. According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, health workers serving at over 150 health facilities have tested positive and the entire services of some hospitals including Narayani Hospital in Birgunj have been halted indefinitely because health workers are recovering from the coronavirus infection. The World Health Organization has said that health workers are at risk on two fronts— shortage of personal protective equipment and the chance of being infected in hospitals.  Inadequate access to personal protective equipment or weak infection prevention and control measures raise the risk of infection among health workers. Health workers can also be exposed to patients who do not show signs of the disease and are in a health facility for a range of other services. Doctors say that chances of infected health workers, especially doctors and nurses, spreading the disease are high if they are not provided with protective gear, as they came in close contact with many people. Moreover, they warned that the Ministry of Health and Population’s decision to place 20 percent Covid-19 patients in every health facility would be disastrous, as most of the hospitals cannot ensure sufficient protective gear, which are too costly for them, according to doctors. As the number of health workers getting infected rises, the government’s plan to have 20 percent of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients has come under fire. Acharya of the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital said that concerned authorities should designate some hospitals as Covid-19 hospitals, instead of reserving 20 percent beds for Covid-19 patients at all hospitals. “They also have to designate holding areas in general hospitals to curb the risk of transmission among other patients and health workers,” he added.  Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital uses 100 sets of personal protective equipment every day.  “We have not compromised on the safety precautions of our health workers,” Dr Sagar Rajbhandari, director at the hospital, told the Post. “But a lot of money is being spent on protective equipment.” The Association of Private Health Institutions Nepal said that concerned agencies should think twice about the decision to place Covid-19 patients in all hospitals.  “Most of the private hospitals cannot afford to handle Covid patients,” Kumar Thapa, former chairman of the association, told the Post. Nepal Medical Association, an umbrella association of medical doctors, is planning a meeting with private hospitals on Wednesday and to submit a memorandum to the government over the safety of health workers. “We will issue a final warning tomorrow to the government,” Dr Mukti Ram Shrestha, former chairman of the Association, said. “We will be compelled to halt services if issues of safety of health workers are not addressed.” The reason for the high number of deaths in Italy in the early days of the pandemic was said to be that Covid-19 patients received care together with the patients of other illnesses in hospitals. The Health Ministry, however, says that it is aware of the lack of safety gears in private and public hospitals.",Health,https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/08/26/health-workers-reusing-disposable-masks-as-hospitals-don-t-supply-enough-doctors-say
140,"The culture, history and recipe of batuk","August 28, 2020","On Maghe Sankranti eve, my mother would make batuk, a ring-shaped deep-fried black lentil fritter, and also boil a variety of tubers such as yam, taro, and sweet potato. We would eat them the following day. People believe that consuming food cooked on Maghe Sankranti day itself is inauspicious. Batuk is a traditional festive delicacy of both the Magar and Khas communities, more celebrated by Magars. They prepare batuk on Maghi, a New Year festival celebrated on the same day of Maghe Sankranti. Magars also eat batuk during weddings, where the groom's family presents batuk to the bride's family along with pig meat, alcohol, and selroti. Newas have their own version of batuks, which are called bara. Tharus in the west also make black lentil fritters known as bariya but it is flat or ball-shaped. In many parts of the world, lentils or bean paste is used to make all kinds of fritters or balls. In the Middle East, falafels are made from chickpeas or fava beans. In West Africa and Brazil, black eyed peas are used to make akara or acaraje. In some South Asian countries, like India, Bangladesh, and Srilanka, a distant cousin of the batuk is the vada or vadai, which is made from lentils. Batuk is usually made from black lentils (maas ko dal) or sometimes from rice beans (masyang). Black lentil (scientific name: Vigna mungo; Hindi: urad; Nepali: maas) is one of the Indian subcontinent's most ancient crops and is even mentioned in ancient Vedic scripture including Atharvaveda dating back to 1000–900 BCE as masa. The name masa, from which its Nepali name is derived, is considered an ancient Dravidian language—still spoken in Southern India—and was adopted to Sanskrit language. The lentil holds special sanctity in Hindu rituals, but isn’t generally offered to higher deities, as it is associated with darkness and death. In Nepal, Khas people make furaula, a round ball-shaped black-lentil fritter, during sraddha, an annual remembrance for deceased parents or ancestors. Fulaura differs from batuk by its shape.  Black lentil is also considered an energy food, cooked into special delicacies like batuk and khichadi (rice and black lentil cooked together) and eaten together with other energy foods such as ghee, jaggery taffy, and a variety of tubers on the winter solstice festival of Maghi or Maghe Sankranti to keep the body warm in cold winter days. Both batuk and Indian vada come from an ancient dish called vataka. The name batuk is borrowed from vataka, an ancient Dravidian word for fermented lentil paste fritters. While the dish is now known in India by its changed name, which is vada, its ancient original name is still preserved in Nepal. Sanskritist Gautam V Vajracharya suggests that some ancient South Asian cultures, including some Vedic and pre-Vedic indigenous customs, managed to survive in Nepal much more meaningfully than other parts of South Asia, which may also hold true for some culinary traditions, including the name of traditional foods. In his book, A Historical Dictionary of Indian Food (1998), the Indian food historian KT Acharya noted that the dish is fully described even in the Sanskrit scripture Dharma Sutras (800-300 BC) as soaked, coarsely ground and fermented black lentils deep fried in ghee. Vataka was also mentioned in the 12th century Manasollasa, an encyclopaedic Sanskrit work. With its long history, batuk has now become a cross-cultural food and spread across regions. In far-west Nepal, Khas eat batuk with buttermilk soup known as chhanch, and in Palpa and Gulmi, locals eat batuk with a spicy and sour potato yoghurt salad known as chukauni. Only ginger, turmeric powder and salt are traditionally added in the lentil paste for flavour. Sometimes my mother would add onion, coriander leaves, and broadleaf mustard greens (rayo ko saag), which add more flavours and texture. I am particularly fond of batuk with rayo ko saag. One can also add other spices such as garlic paste, cumin powder, chilli powder, or black pepper powder. One doesn’t have to wait for Maghe Sankranti or Maghi to eat batuk! It is easy to make and nutritious. Here is how you can make it at home. Ingredients: (Serves 2-3 people) 1 large cup black lentil (kalo maas) 3 tablespoons ginger paste 1 tablespoon garlic paste (optional) 1 teaspoon turmeric powder Salt 2 cups vegetable oil, for frying  Directions: 1. Soak black lentils overnight or for at least 5–6 hours. Massage soaked lentils with your hands and wash several times to remove the outer black layer. It is not necessary to remove all the outer layers. Drain the lentils completely. 2. Grind the lentils into a medium-fine paste. In early days, lentils were ground in silauto (flat stone mortar) or okhal (cylindrical-shaped stone or wooden mortar). Slightly grainy paste gives batuk a texture and makes it fluffy. 3. Transfer the paste to a large bowl. Add salt, turmeric powder, ginger paste, and garlic paste (optional) and mix them together. 4. Leave the paste for at least half an hour—or better, overnight—to let ferment naturally. Fermentation gives flavour and makes batuk soft and fluffy.",Food,https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2020/08/28/the-culture-history-and-recipe-of-batuk
141, Who owns recipes?,"August 14, 2020","Last month, I published a recipe of kwati with goat meat in The Kathmandu Post daily that sparked many strong criticisms on social media. Some criticised the dish for adding a non-traditional ingredient to a traditional dish. Some called me out for being a non-indigenous person appropriating a traditional recipe of an indigenous community.  Newas cook kwati, a soup made from nine varieties of legumes, on the full moon festival 'Kwaati Punhi’. This traditional dish is sometimes cooked with buffalo meat, momo, flour dumplings, but not customarily with goat meat.  I understand where the criticisms came from. Food is never just food. Food is culture and identity. For some communities, food is associated with a painful history of colonialism and cultural oppression. In Nepal, historically, food has been used as a tool for social exclusion and casteism.  The criticisms, largely, likely owed to my 'higher' caste Khas-Bahun surname. Historically, the so-called higher castes were responsible for social, political, cultural dominance, which still exists today. Thus, I understand why some Newas have raised concerns.  And while I understand where their concerns come from, it’s important for readers too to understand the writer’s intention behind the recipe. It’s also important to understand whether the recipe is de-contextualised from its culture or not. Sometimes, we tend to overshoot with criticism without realising the context. In the article, I clearly described kwati, its culture, and that the Kathmandu's non-Newas adopted the recipe from Newa culture.  Many people don’t realise that I also belong to the Newa community. My mother is Newa. I grew up adopting parts of both cultures; for instance, eating goat meat as well as buffalo meat and consuming alcohol as a sagun, which Bahuns traditionally avoid for religious reasons. Although my mother didn't cook kwati at home, I remember having it at my mamaghar [a mother’s paternal home] when young. I got more acquainted with the kwati culture after I moved to Kathmandu in the early 2000s. Now, I make kwati every year during the Kwati Punhi festival. I find the one with tempering of ghee and jwano delectable. If I had my mother’s surname, would the kwati with goat meat recipe have been more acceptable? I grew up in a mixed culture. Does that mean I have less authority over the food than 'unmixed' Newas or Bahuns? More than who the writer is, what the writer has written is more important, and whether the culture that the recipe belongs to is acknowledged or not, respected or not, is important.  It’s always nice to read a recipe from a writer of the same community the recipe belongs to, and if the media gives them the space. But shouldn’t someone be able to write about foods outside of their origin as well? Also, as I wrote in the article The Taste of Whiteness, one can experiment with recipes but the intent, mindset and sincerity of the writer is what matters the most.  With food, there is a fine line between culture adoption, cultural assimilation, and cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation is when the dominant class takes food of a minority community and capitalises or profits from it, often portraying the food as their own or not acknowledging the community. Altering a traditional recipe without understanding the culture and history behind it is also inappropriate.  Cultural assimilation can be negative. Cultural assimilation is when the minority communities or immigrants are absorbed in the dominant culture. Minorities may be forced to assimilate unknowingly—they assimilate in order to survive or avoid backlash from the more powerful community, which might mean gradually losing some of their culture. The assimilation often manifests in food. For example, Newa Muslims taking buffalo meat instead of beef. Newas adopted momos from Tibet. We then added our own local ingredients. This isn’t cultural appropriation. There was no cultural dominance of one group over another. There is also a difference between the historical adoption of foods by a community, and media and restaurants' appropriating food with an intention of modernising, upgrading, or making palatable a dish for a certain class or race, and that too without acknowledging its origin.  Some also criticised that I instilled higher Khas caste culture and class superiority to the traditional dish by adding goat meat. I agree that higher castes considered goat meat superior to buffalo or pig meat. This notion of superiority might be also the reason why goat and wild boar meat are comparatively expensive. Until recent decades, meat itself was associated with class—only certain classes could afford meat regularly. But that was not my intention in the recipe. I grew up eating both goat and buffalo meat. I like the taste of goat meat. Buffalo meat is a Newa’s traditional food. However, some Newas sacrifice and consume goat and pig, albeit higher caste Newas adopting goat meat was likely influenced by Hindu caste-based food practice. Did I think about cultural appropriation and class before writing the recipe? Yes.  There are a few reasons why I chose to publish the recipe instead of the original Newa recipe. First, kwati is popular and well-known to many Nepalis. Many publications have already published about kwati. I have written about it too. Second, many Kathmandu non-Newas, not just Khas, have adopted the kwati recipe. Some make it adding goat meat. Third, I wanted to write about a different recipe, one which I have been cooking for years and love. It was not my intention to prioritise the new recipe over the original or portray a sense of superiority of one over the other.  Would I change the traditional recipe of Newa’s kakwa/bulla (fermented rice ‘thown’ dregs and buffalo meat soup) or Sherpa’s phalgi (dried young maize and bean soup)? Should the media publish those refashioned recipes? No. I believe that altering the recipes of the cultural food that are barely known to the mass is inappropriate.  Food history researcher Binti Gurung, who grew up in a Gurung community outside Kathmandu Valley, started eating kwati when she moved to Kathmandu in the 90s. “So,l for many in our community, can it be described as an adopted cultural food practice?” she asks. Like Binti Gurung, many Non-Newas have adopted some aspects of Newa food culture and mixed with their own.  Like it or not, popular Newa dishes such as kwati and chhoila have transcended the bounds of Newa culture. I believe that is a good thing. Historically, momo wasn’t a Newa dish; but it is now. As momos became popular outside Kathmandu (thanks to the Tibetan diaspora), many Nepalis now consider it their own. This is how cultures everywhere have evolved for generations and will continue to do so. Food and culture don’t thrive in isolation. But it’s important that we don’t forget its history, origin, and cultural significance. ",Food,https://kathmandupost.com/food/2020/08/14/who-owns-recipes
142,Pair kwati with some goat meat this Kwati Punhi ,"July 31, 2020","After a couple of months of arduous work on paddy fields, Kathmandu’s farmers nourish their body by consuming mixed sprouted legumes soup called ‘Kwati’ on the full moon festival ‘Kwati Punhi' or ‘Gunhu Punhi’. Newas celebrate the festival towards the end of monsoon. Also known as Janai Purnima, Hindus celebrate the day by tying a sacred thread around their body and wrist. Kwati is prepared from a mixture of nine types of legumes; some say the nine legumes signify the ninth month of Nepal Sambat calendar in which the festival is celebrated. The legumes include fava bean, soybean, mung bean, gram, field pea, garden pea, black-eyed pea, etc. The legumes are soaked overnight, germinated, and cooked into soup. Locals believe that the soup makes the body immune to seasonal ailments and improves the digestive system.  During the germination, the legumes go through bio-chemical changes and become more nutritive with increase in amino acids, polyphenols, Vitamin C, minerals, and decline in starch and anti-nutrients. Research suggests that the increase in helpful bacteria Lactobacillus bifidus during the germination, which inhibits the growth of harmful microbes, is good for your digestive tract. This, along with the bio-chemical changes, is probably what gives kwati soup its distinctive, delicious flavour, something that you won’t get from just-soaked beans. Kwati in Newa language translates to hot soup—‘kwa’ means ‘hot’ and ‘ti’ refers to ‘soup’. The word ‘kwa’ is also used in other Newa dishes such as ka-kwa, pancha-kwa, paun-kwa. ‘Kwa’ more likely refers to ‘various ingredients’.  In Newa households, sometimes bone-in buffalo meat, chhuchunmari (wheat flour dumplings or roti), or even momo are added in kwati. Some of Kathmandu’s non-Newas adopt the kwati recipe and cook it with goat meat (colloquially known as mutton in South Asia).  Kwati is in itself delicious but bone-in goat meat adds to the flavour. Goat meat has a good dense gamey flavour and aroma—good for making soup. The bone marrow, fats, and meat add rich flavour, and gelatinous skin thickens the soup and gives texture. I am not sure if the recipe is common but I got this recipe from a Khas-family living in Kathmandu. The soup is delicious and I make it at least once a year during Kwati Punhi. Here it is so you can try to make it too: Ingredients: (Serves 3–4 people) 200 gm kwati beans 250–300 gm bone-in goat meat or goat legs, cut in bite-size pieces 1 onion, medium sized 3–4 cloves 3–4 green cardamoms 2–3 bay leaves (tejpatta) 1 cinnamon stick 1 tablespoon garlic and ginger paste 1 teaspoon turmeric powder 1 teaspoon cumin and coriander powder 1 teaspoon red-chili powder 1 teaspoon garam masala, optional 2–3 tomatoes, medium-sized 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Salt  For marinating meat: 1 teaspoon ginger and garlic paste 1 teaspoon cumin and coriander powder 1/3 teaspoon black pepper powder ½ teaspoon turmeric powder 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 teaspoon salt For spice tempering: 1 tablespoon ghee",Food,https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2020/07/31/pair-kwati-with-some-goat-meat-this-kwati-punhi
143,The taste of whiteness,"July 24, 2020","Last month, Bon Appétit, an American food magazine, apologised to its readers and pledged to address issues of cultural appropriation, cultural de-contextualisation, the white gaze, and tokenisation that are present—consciously or unconsciously—in the magazine’s content. The apology was issued after a racially discriminatory image of the magazine’s editor-in-chief surfaced on social media, bringing to the fore such underlying issues.  While the magazine has promised to make efforts to be inclusive and open-minded, it is unfortunate that it took the magazine such an incident to come out and acknowledge that their content and many of their in-house work practices weren’t just improper but also deeply problematic, culturally insensitive and discriminatory. What was more unfortunate was the fact the said events unfolded only after the magazine’s non-white assistant editor Sohla El-Waylly raised those concerns, even though the magazine claimed in an email that it was not the first time they have discussed those issues internally. It is no secret that mainstream western media has often described foods from their white lens. In a recent New York Times article on Thailand’s fruits, the writer Hannah Beech described rambutan as ‘resembling coronavirus’, durian as ‘stinks of death and whiff of skunk’, and dragon fruit as ‘bland mush with tiny seeds that can require floss to dislodge’, descriptions that callously disparaged the country’s prized fruits.  When western mainstream media is not misrepresenting Asian food, it is often portraying non-European foods in a way that shows they have discovered and bettered it. It is as if until the west knows about it, food is not discovered yet; and until they appropriate it, it’s not palatable.  While such news about the magazine erupted, I couldn’t help but remember a Guardian article on jackfruits published last year. The writer Zoe Williams, who encountered jackfruit for the first time in a Starbucks wrap, described jackfruit as ‘a spectacularly ugly, smelly, unfarmed, un-harvested pest-plant native to India’. In the piece, the writer goes on to say: “In India, some people ate it, but only if they had nothing better to eat.” Such remarks do not only reflect ignorance, but show us how deeply embedded the notion of supremacy is in the west. The jackfruit, a native vegetable to South Asia and South East Asia, is ingrained in the region’s culinary culture—be it Indonesian sweet gudeg or Nepali and Indian spice-rich curry. In these countries where the jackfruit is found, locals love the seasonal treat, and consume it as a vegetable when young and as fruit when ripe. Hundreds of tons of Indian jackfruit are transported to western countries every season, yet the writer—at least in the piece—seemed unaware of the fruit’s culinary significance. She did not give a recipe nor did she mention that ripened jackfruit seeds can be consumed, perhaps she did not know.  And this is why much of mainstream food writing is white-centric: people with little understanding about the food or culture are given the space to write about it, and that too without cultural appraisal. The bigger problem is how a certain race exerts their hegemony and indoctrinates a certain culture. The writer’s delusional perception that “western veganism is going to save the ‘pest-plant’ jackfruit” is associated with a deep-running mindset of supremacy and a white saviour complexity. For example, in food travel shows, a white (usually male) celebrity chef goes to some rural area in a country in Asia and shows locals how to cook better, appropriating the local ingredients and recipes to their comfort. This is how many food travel shows are typically curated. In fact, many of the dishes they cook are culturally appropriated or white-washed. And the humble locals pretend to like the food. In such media, mostly owned and held by whites, this is the standard that is used over and over again.  But bigger questions remain: Who gets the space in these media with global outreach and influence? Who decides who and what gets the space? Who gets to set the food narrative—what’s delicious, what’s palatable, and what’s pretty? ‘Bizarre’, ‘ugly’, ‘delicious’—for whom? Who defines the standard?  Different cultures have their own tastes. Consuming innards, which is a part of the Asian culture, is often depicted by western food shows (and magazines) as something to frown upon. For many Nepalis, eating a big lump of meat (steak) and that too barely cooked is unusual. What looks unpalatable, what tastes bad, and what smells unpleasant are subjective. Asian foods are commonly associated by westerners as spicy. White people frequently asking if the food (mostly Asian) is spicy before tasting is—frankly—a bit annoying, even offensive. Chillies are not used just for heat but to bring out added flavour and texture. Taste is acquired. If you didn’t grow-up in the culture of eating padeak (Lao fermented fish sauce) or kinema (Nepali fermented soybeans), you may not like them at first. You may find it pungent or find the act of eating something so alien offensive, but for the people who have grown up eating them, the same flavours give them comfort; they revel in it. Everything you taste in this world is an acquired taste. And you have to train your palate to be accepting of new flavours. Appropriating recipes from a culture, supposedly to upgrade it or make it more palatable for a western or White-American palate, is sheer disrespect. It’s not that one can’t play with recipes, but what is the intent and mindset behind the tampering are questions that need clear answers. Also, acknowledging the culture where the recipe originated from is a must.  With constant indoctrination by western media and white celebrity chefs on what’s delicious and what’s palatable, we have started questioning our own taste and culinary culture. For instance, the notion that olive oil is better than mustard oil is a result of that. We tend to incorporate European recipes into our traditional ways of living; in fact, many restaurants in Kathmandu tone down the spices (not just the heat of chilli) in an effort to make dishes more palatable for tourists.  The food you eat is a major part of the culture you grew up in or associate yourself with. They are somehow your identity. And when your identity is questioned and lampooned, sentiments get hurt.

144,"In the midst of a pandemic, a cafe becomes a place of refuge for stranded people","July 20, 2020","On March 24, when Nepal went into lockdown, 20-year-old Agni Bishwokarma, who works as a security guard in Boudha, found himself in a problem. The lunch places that he usually frequents were all shut, and for the first few days of the lockdown, Bishwokarma made do by skipping lunch at work. For a few days, he even prepared his own lunch and carried to work, but his odd duty hours didn't make it a very feasible thing to do. ""We then learned that Utpala Cafe in Boudha was serving free lunch to people, and since then my colleague and I have been coming here every day for lunch,"" said Bishwokarma, who has been coming to Utpala Cafe for the past three months. These are not the best of times for the restaurant industry. For months, the lockdown forced all the restaurants in the city to close, and those that have now opened wear a deserted look. All of these make Utpala Cafe, a for-profit establishment run by Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling Monastery, a Buddhist monastery in Boudha, an anomaly. Not only has the cafe remained open from the beginning of the lockdown, but it has served free buffet lunch to people from the first day of the lockdown, becoming a go-to place among stranded foreigners and locals in precarious financial situations. ""When we decided to keep the cafe open during the lockdown, it was mainly to feed our monastery's foreign students, who were stranded in the country due to the lockdown,"" said Lopon Shedrub Gyatso, a senior monk at Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling Monastery.  But what the monastery had no inkling of was in Boudha there were dozens of foreigners stranded, and with cafes in the locality closed due to lockdown, many of them didn't have anywhere to dine. So it wasn't long before those stranded people started showing up at Utpala.  ""On day two or three of the lockdown, a few stranded foreigners, who had nowhere else to eat, came to our cafe. Sending them away without feeding them was out of the question,"" said Gyatso. ""When our monastery's head abbot, Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche, learned about the increasing number of foreigners coming to our cafe for lunch, he instructed us to continue feeding anyone coming to the cafe for free, and that’s how we started.""  However, feeding so many people at the height of the lockdown has been anything but easy. The majority of the cafe's staff had already left for their respective villages, and Deepak Bohara, the cafe's general manager, didn't have enough workforce to prepare meals for so many people. ""For the first few days into the lockdown, we just prepared rice at the cafe and sourced vegetable curry and lentils from our monastery,"" said Bohara, who was even taken to the police station two weeks into the lockdown for not adhering to the government mandate that required all businesses to close. ""When we explained to the police officials that we were open just to provide free lunch to needy people, they finally let me go.""  Until that incident, the cafe was solely focused on providing free meals to people and hadn't given much thought on safety protocols. ""We realised that if we are to continue to operate, we should have certain safety procedures in place to ensure the safety of our staff, diners, and to assure the authorities so that they would let us operate,"" said Bohara. ""We then rearranged our seating layout to allow one diner per table and ensure there’s a safe distance between two tables. We also made wearing masks mandatory inside the cafe and placed sanitisers for diners to use."" Utpala Cafe’s free lunch buffet is offered from 10 am to 1:30 pm, and according to Bohara, anywhere between 80 to 100 people come to the cafe every day for lunch. “We change the buffet menu every day,” said Bohara. On a sunny afternoon last week, the buffet menu had vegetarian burgers, fried lentil patties, cauliflower soup, and salad.  ""With the lockdown eased, the cafes I used to frequent are now open. But given that Covid-19 is still a threat, I don't feel very confident about eating at places I used to before the lockdown because I don’t think those places will be as serious as Utpala when it comes to safety and hygiene,” said Bishwokarma. “On top of that, those restaurants have all increased their food prices and I don't earn much money. By continuing to come here to Utpala, I get to save my lunch money.""  According to Bohara, the restaurant’s floor is washed with chlorine everyday, the kitchen is sanitised twice a day, and once a week, the cafe’s entire premises is deep cleaned.  Like Bishwokarma, for 41-year-old Florian Fleck and his 61-year-old mother, both German citizens, it was the prospect of free lunch that brought them to Utpala almost two months ago, but the cafe has now become their place of refuge. The mother and son duo had arrived in Nepal in March, and they had planned to stay in the country for two weeks before heading to India. But a few days after their arrival, Nepal went into lockdown, and they have been stuck in the country since. ""Not long after we had arrived, we had an issue with our atm card, and we soon ran out of money. Around two months ago, we learned about Utpala's free lunch programme through some people, and that's how we ended up here,"" said Fleck. ""When we came here to the cafe, neither did we have money nor a place to stay. The monks from the monastery have been kind enough to offer us three meals at the cafe and a place to stay, all for free."" In return, Fleck and his mother help maintain the cafe's garden. ""I am extremely grateful to the cafe and the monastery for all that they have done and continue to do so for my mother and me,"" said Fleck. For some of the cafe's regular visitors, it's not the free lunch that brings them to the cafe. ""These are stressful times, and for many of us who don’t live with family, the cafe has served as a place to unwind, and de-stress,"" said Karma, a resident of Boudha and regular visitor to the cafe. ""We are social beings, and we need social interactions. Staying holed up in rooms alone might protect you from the virus, but it can have a detrimental impact on one's mental health. Being able to come to the cafe and sit in its spacious garden, enjoy a cup of coffee, interact with people, safely of course, have been a blessing in these stressful times.”  Seventy-six-year-old Erna, a Dutch citizen and a regular at Utpala, agrees with Karma. ""I stay alone in a hotel room nearby, but I can't stay the whole day in my room all alone. So I come here to get some fresh air, meet, and interact with people,"" said Erna.  But Erna doesn't quite agree with the cafe providing anybody who walks in with free lunch. ""The free lunch is a huge help to those who cannot afford it, but I also see a lot of people who can very well afford to pay but do not have to. And I wonder if the cafe could have instead used the resources to feed the many poor people you see in and around Boudha,"" said Erna.

145,"The story, and history, behind yomari and chaku","July 17, 2020","In December, on the day when the moon is at its fullest, the Newas celebrate Yomari Punhi, essentially a rice harvest festival. Also known as Dhanya Purnima (in Sanskrit), the festival is observed by offering rice to the goddess of grain, ‘Annapurna’, and making a sweet delicacy ‘yomari’—a steamed rice flour dumpling filled with chaku (jaggery taffy) and sesame seeds or with khuwa (evaporated milk solids) and shredded coconut.  On this day, families get together to make yomari, and young people go around the neighbourhood singing, asking for yomari—an act known as ‘yomari phonegu' or ‘tyachim tya phonegu’. People make various shapes of yomari, including shapes of gods and goddesses such as Laxmi, Ganesh, Kubera, and Saraswati, and place it in the bhakari—a large grain basket used for storing—as an offering to the gods, thanking them for a good harvest. In the town of Sankhu, locals also take out a procession for god Ganesh; and in Harisiddhi, locals perform a masked dance.  Locals have different versions regarding the origin of the yomari. One legend has it that a couple in Panchal (today’s Panauti) prepared this form of confection and distributed it to their neighbours. The neighbours loved the confection and hence named it yomari—the Newa word ‘ya’ translates ‘to like’ and ‘mari’ to ‘roti or flatbread’. The legend goes that Kubera, the god of wealth, who had come to the village disguised as a beggar was also given yomari. He was very happy with the couple’s generosity and blessed them with wealth and prosperity. He told the couple that anyone who prepares yomari with the shapes of gods and goddesses on the full moon day will be blessed with wealth and prosperity. Since then, it is believed that the Newa community started celebrating the festival.  But historians have different stories to tell. According to the book ‘Social History of Nepal’, the Bhasa Vamsavali found in Kathmandu Valley mentions that the people of Kathmandu started making yomaris from the time of Amshuverma, from 6th CE.  The authors of the book—Tulasi Ram Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi—suggest that Newas might have adopted the culture from the Tibetans and even further north, Korean, which also prepare yomari-like sweets. But it is more likely that yomari has its roots in the modaka, a similar Indian sweet—rice flour dumplings filled with jaggery and coconut. Modaka is considered one of the most ancient sweets in India. According to Indian food historian KT Acharya, the sweet may date back to 200 BCE. In the Indian plains, the sweet is prepared annually during Hindu festival Ganesha Chaturthi as an offering to god Ganesha, the god of prosperity and well-being. The teardrop-shaped modaka is believed to be beloved sweets of Ganesha. A Ganesh temple at Ticchugalli, Patan, has a statue of tichhu (shrew), the vehicle of God Ganesha, holding modaka—its master’s favourite delicacy. And maybe the word yomari is coined for the very reason of being God Ganesh’s beloved sweets. It is well known that culture doesn’t thrive in isolation. And it wouldn’t be wrong in surmising that some Newa sweets are adopted or influenced by sweets found in the southern neighbour, India. Some other Newa sweets such as jeri and halwa have roots to Persian sweets that travelled via India.  While the origin of the yomari might be linked to the modaka, the way the yomari is shaped and its filling make it unique to Newa culture. Newas use chaku (pulled jaggery taffy) instead of jaggery, and artfully mould the delicacy into a unique teardrop shape without the pleats as in the Indian modaka.  People also have different hypotheses on the yomari’s shape—some refer to it as a fish and others as gajur or shrine of a temple. It has also been linked to a citrus fruit Jambhara (in Sanskrit), known as tahsi in Newa and bimiro in Nepali language, which bears a similar shape. This citrus fruit, Citrus medica, is considered an old and original citrus species from which other varieties of citrus cultivar arose.  In Newa culture, tahsi is worshipped as a deity during Mha puja—a festival for worshipping of the self, which earlier was the ‘worship of fetus’, according to Sanskritist and Scholar Gautam V Vajracharya. Newas also worship tahsi during Mohani Nakha or Dashain. This yellow autumnal fruit represents longevity, wealth, prosperity, and fertility.  The fruit holds cultural religious significance in both Hinduism and Buddhism. In Hindu tradition, women who wish to become pregnant also worship Jambhara, an alternative Sankrit word is bijapura, meaning seed-filled. The Buddhist version of the god of wealth Kubera is known as Jambhala, the name derived from the citron fruit jambhara. The Jamabhala is often depicted with him holding a teardrop-shaped fruit in his hand.  Yomari is also eaten on occasions other than Yomari Punhi in Newa society. Parents feed pregnant daughters yomari and also prepare the delicacy to celebrate even-numbered birthdays of children until they turn 12.  During Yomari Punhi, people also make mayo and bayo yomari: mayo, filled with black lentils, symbolises the female sexual organ, and bayo, filled with chaku and sesame seeds, symbolises the male sexual organ. The two are a symbolic representation of two sexes. Even the ‘yomari phonegu’ practice is considered to be the meeting of loved ones and seeking romance. While yomari epitomises the rich Newa culture, the chaku is the culture’s soul. Chaku is jaggery taffy, an essential item eaten during the first day of the month Magh (December-January), known as Ghya Chaku Sanhlu in Kathmandu. Yomari Punhi occurs around winter solstice and Ghya Chaku Sanhlu marks the end of extreme winter. During the peak of winter, chaku gives energy and keeps the body warm.  To make the chakku, sugarcane jaggery is boiled until caramelised. Then the warm sticky mass is pulled and stretched laboriously hundreds of times which then becomes the smooth, glossy chaku. The stretching and pulling changes the colour of the jaggery from dark to brown, makes it glossy, and aerates to make it light, brittle and chewy. Caramelisation helps in creating this light bitterness that balances the sweetness of jaggery. Jaggery is one of the oldest forms of sweeteners and was produced in the Indian subcontinent for hundreds of years, likely before 600 BCE. Even the word ‘sugar’ and ‘candy’ has etymological roots to its Sanskrit word ‘sakkara’ and ‘khand’. Historical narrative suggests the existence of sugarcane plantation fields in Kathmandu—the Kathmandu’s location ‘Tukucha besi’ came from the Newa word for sugarcane, and its other name ‘Icchumati’ too, in which icchu is sanskrit word for sugarcane. Tokha, a Newa settlement north of Kathmandu city, is popular for making chaku; its name ‘tu-khya’ means sugarcane-field in Newa language. There aren’t many historical accounts that track when and how the culture of chaku was developed or introduced in Kathmandu Valley. But the culture of making jaggery and crystallised form of sugar might have come from India, and the know-how of making taffy (fanid in) probably originally came from Iran. If so, how did the Newas adopt the culture? Is the tradition of making yomari with chaku and khuwa and nuts originally of Newa origin? We don’t know, yet.",Food,https://kathmandupost.com/food/2020/07/17/the-story-and-history-behind-yomari-and-chaku
146,Food that divides us,"June 19, 2020","In the book ‘Social History of Nepal’, the authors—Tulasi Ram Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi—account that the people who drink alcohol and eat buffalo meat were looked down upon by supposedly higher castes. Because of this culture, some Newas, who were close to Ranas and employed in high post, gave up drinking alcohol and eating buff publicly even though those customs were followed while worshipping ancestral deities. They considered themselves elevated in social status by abhorring those customs in public.  In a society, already stratified with class, high caste folks have not only dictated the supremacy of their social norms but also food culture. As much as food has connected us, historically, some food practices have also been used as tools for social exclusion. What you eat has historically defined your class and vice versa. Growing up in two cultures—Newa and Bahun—with contrasting practices and values, I have observed how food has defined the differences and supremacy of one culture to another. In my mother’s Newa culture, people revere buffalo meat and alcohol, and even offer them to deities. Whereas my father’s Bahun community abstains from consuming buff and alcohol, and considers people who practice such a culture of belonging to an inferior class.  Although we have embraced and enjoyed both the cultures at our home, still, till this day, goat and buffalo meat are cooked separately during Dashain and Tihar to avoid contamination and to make the meat acceptable for my father’s kin.  My paternal grandmother abstained from visiting our home for a very long time and never ate the food cooked by my mother. As dictated by society, this culinary casteism—who is allowed in the kitchen and purity of food—still exists.  “Even higher caste Newas refrained from consuming buffalo meat,” recalled historian Tri Ratna Manandhar, one of the authors of the book. “They consumed goat meat, which is associated with the higher castes. In the Kathmandu Valley, only the lower caste consumed pig.” In 1854, through the first Muluki Ain, Rana Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana legalised centuries-old societal hierarchy of caste and class and institutionalised it throughout the country, including among the non-Hindus. The state divided Nepali society into tagadhari (Hindu sacred-thread wearer), matwali (alcohol consumer) and dalit (untouchable) classes. The code also put strict regulations on caste-based food practices, especially on consumption of alcohol and meat.  Brahmin and Chhetri, the tagadharis, were considered socially superior to the matwalis, and they wouldn’t eat the food cooked by people belonging to the lower caste. Dalits, the untouchables, were the lowest class in the hierarchy, and even water touched by them was considered impure. They were even abstained from directly fetching water from the water source and entering the houses of the higher castes.  These rules were designed by the higher caste to fit their necessity. Even though utensils made or grains harvested by supposedly untouchable caste were deemed usable by the upper caste, food cooked by lower caste were deemed impure.  Historically, many ethnic communities, including Dalits, in Nepal had beef-eating practice. But the killing of cows was outlawed nationwide by the Hindu Shah king in 1805. The state sent out public notice all over the country stating that anyone who slaughters a cow will be given a death sentence and their property confiscated. The 1854 Muluki Ain reduced the capital punishment to life imprisonment for intentional killing and fine for negligent killing.  Today, consuming beef is allowed in the country, but slaughtering a cow is still proscribed, earlier as a sacred animal and now as a national animal. But because of centuries of state’s systematic indoctrination, beef-eating is frowned upon, even within the communities that once practised eating beef. Some even exhibit their superiority to those who continued, often secretly, consuming the meat of cows that died naturally or by accident.  Gurungs, who didn’t have the culture of eating pig, claimed to be superior to the pig-consuming ethnicities. Many Thakalis abstain from consuming yak, which was commonly consumed by neighbouring communities. Even though Hindu higher caste folks frown upon consuming pig, they, except Bahuns, consume wild boar as a delicacy. The acceptance was probably because of the influence of the ruling class, royals and Ranas, who commonly consumed wild boar.  I remember, at my mamaghar (maternal uncle home), how maiju would hesitate to serve me millet dhido when I was young. In Bahun and other higher castes, millet was considered as an impure or bad grain (ku-anna) and a poor person’s staple. This reasoning could be partly because of the association of millet with lower caste and alcohol making. Although the higher caste consumed millet, they abstained consuming the grain during religious ceremonies. In most hilly matwali communities, millet is a staple and even offered to their ancestral deities. ""Although Newas in Kathmandu Valley ate millet, its dishes were never included in the bhoye. Only baji (beaten rice) was served,"" says Manandhar. When asked if it was because millet was perceived as an inferior or lower class grain, he opines that it is possibly not the case. But rice has always symbolised class.  Rice, from the very onset, was considered a superior grain, and only well-offs and the ruling class could afford to consume it on a daily basis. Consuming rice reflected one's higher status in society. For that very reason, many communities shifted their staples from traditional grains such as millet, buckwheat, barley, naked-barley and sorghum to rice.  But for centuries, barley and rice were considered pure and even used in Hindu’s rituals and sacrificial offerings to Agni, the god of fire. The concept of pure (chokho) and impure (bitulo) food is ingrained in Hindu and can be traced back to vedic era, some 3,500 years ago.  Today, things have evolved: even varieties of rice have class. Aromatic rice is the most preferred and consumed by rich royals and elites. Ghaiya, dry-land rice grown in hills and consumed largely by hilly ethnic communities, are considered lower in status.  But with changing society, new generations have challenged the conventional notion of what to eat and what not to eat according to caste. There was once a time when orthodox Bahuns abstained from consuming chicken and mushroom. But today many new generation Bahuns consume pork, buffalo meat, and alcohol, albeit they practice this outside his home. In recent times, food has slowly become less about the caste but more about economic class—not saying that it wasn’t the case before. But as it is with everything in life, food cultures change over time too. For instance, rice was once one of the most expensive grains, but today it is becoming inexpensive and accessible. Other grains such as buckwheat, millet and barley are becoming pricier. The growing urban middle class are attracted toward these grains primarily for health reasons. .

147,Yangben: The wild delicacy of the Limbus,"June 12, 2020","The Limbus, an indigenous people from Nepal’s eastern hills, have interesting and unique food traditions. Wild edible lichen, known as yangben, is the community’s signature speciality. Limbus cook yangben with meat, especially pork, to make a variety of dishes. And one of the most loved delicacies is yangben-faksa, pork with lichen. Another popular dish is blood sausage, known as sargemba or sargyangma, which is made by adding lichen to minced meat or innards.  Yangben doesn't have any flavour or aroma on its own but when cooked with fatty pork, it absorbs the fat and lends a delicious earthy flavour to the dish. Pork and yangben marry well together. Because of the yangben's popularity, neighbouring Rai and other communities have also adopted yangben in their food culture. But from where and how did the lichen become part of traditional Limbu food? Let’s find out. As with the kinema (fermented soybeans) and alcohol drinking, the history of lichen consumption in Nepal probably has its origins in current southern China's Yunnan region. Limbu’s ancestors came to Nepal’s eastern hills from Yunnan via Northern Burma and Assam, according to historians. According to the book 'Kirat history and Culture', written by Imanshing Chemjong, the Limbus came to eastern Nepal around the seventh century and joined a related group called Kirats who came to the region much earlier.  Lichen is considered ancient food in Yunnan, and in Nepal only the Limbus have traditionally consumed lichen even though it’s widely available across the country’s hills and mountains. Based on this observation, it is only plausible that Limbus might have brought the practice of eating lichen from the Yunnan region. Here's another example that supports the claim that the practice of eating lichen in Nepal might have come from the north-east: In 1871, the British Medical Officer John Anderson encountered lichen in a local market of Northern Burma, next to Yunnan, during his expedition from Calcutta to Western Yunnan. ‘A dried, almost black lichen,' he reported, 'is sold commonly as an article of food, and mushrooms are much run after.’ People in many parts of the world—Northern Europe, Siberia, North America, Central Asia, and South-East Asia—also consume lichen as food. In India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, people use a lichen known as kalpasi or patthar ka phool to flavour biryani and meat stews.  There’s another hypothesis that as with many other wild vegetables, the practice of eating lichen might have come from humans' survival instinct. People had to make use of whatever ingredients grew around them.  Lichen is a composite organism made up of symbiotic relations of different species of algae, cyanobacteria, and fungi. Limbu and Rai communities consume three lichen species: Everniastrum cirrhatum, Everniastrum nepalense, and Parmotrema cetratum. These filamentous or small leaf-like lichens grow on old chestnut, rhododendron and alder trees. The process of making yangben is easy. It starts with foraging, then the collected yangben is boiled in water with firewood ash for a few hours. When boiled with ash, yangben turns from light greenish-white to dark-brown. Alkaline ash is used because it removes the lichen’s toxicity, reduces bitterness and makes it tender. There are a few other Nepali communities that also use alkali: Chepangs use firewood ash to eliminate the toxicity and bitterness of wild tubers, and in Mustang, people use naturally found alkaline salt to tenderize dried greens. Anyway, back to the yangben. After the yangben turns dark-brown, it is then washed with cold water several times until the water runs clean, then the yangben is sun-dried and stored for later use.  In Nepal, people also use lichens to make dyes and for ritual and medicinal purposes. However, the availability of the traditional lichen is declining, says Shyam Sunuwar, owner of a Sabi-Siwani Sekuwa Ghar in Talchikhel, Lalitpur. He sources yangben from Panchthar and Ramechhap, and processes and sells it in his restaurant. ",Food,https://kathmandupost.com/food/2020/06/12/yangben-the-wild-delicacy-of-the-limbus
148,Will food delivery platforms survive the pandemic?,"May 22, 2020","While the majority of people in the Kathmandu valley are staying home to practice social distancing, Rupen Gurung is spending most of his time out on the road, rushing to make deliveries from restaurants and vegetable shops to customers in a small van. The 20-year-old, who has been working for the last two years for food delivery platform Foodmandu, takes around 15-16 orders daily. And Gurung is not complaining about the extra work. Amid the employment crisis created by the pandemic, he is grateful to have not been laid off and still has a monthly income. “I am helping people, by bringing food to them, and, at the same time, I am still able to financially support my parents,” said Gurung, who came to Kathmandu from Makwanpur two years ago to study as well as to earn a living. But Gurung is concerned how long he’ll be able to hold on to his job.  The hospitality sector in the country has been hit hard by the pandemic and food delivery platforms like Foodmandu have been directly affected. To keep business afloat, the company Gurung works for started delivering daily essentials as well as takeaways. But as cases rise steadily and transportation restrictions tighten, the demand for daily essentials too has steeply declined, said Manohar Adhikari, the owner of Foodmandu. If the situation continues, the future for such businesses is uncertain.  “Before the lockdown, there were around 500 restaurants associated with us. However, due to Covid-19, we are now only working with 50 restaurants,” said Adhikari. And Foodmandu is not alone. Other major online delivery hubs such as Foodmario, Bhoj Deal and Sasto Deal have also reported a steep decline in orders, setting stage for a devastating few months for such businesses.  According to Rohit Tiwari, owner of Foodmario, the company has only been able to conduct only 30 percent of its usual business following the lockdown. “Since the lockdown, we have been delivering only essential food products such as vegetables, fruits, meats and daily products. Although we get orders, the demand is very low,” said Tiwari. With shops and restaurants closed, it would seem that people are ordering more, but they are not, said Tiwari, and it could be because people are scared to get in contact with outsiders. “In the first two weeks of the lockdown, we were getting decent orders, as many as 100 a day. However, as the news related to Covid-19 and as death cases rose, people seem to have gotten more scared. This could be why many people are becoming sceptical of ordering and getting food from strangers,” said Tiwari. This decline in business has already taken a toll on the workforce. In Tiwari’s company, he has already asked the majority of his staff to go on unpaid leave.  “Before the lockdown, we were the team of 37 employees of which 22 of them were delivery boys. However, now, out of 11 team members, only 8 or 9 delivery boys are on duty” said Tiwari. “ We will ask the others to return for work once our business is back on track.” At Foodmandu too, out of around 150 delivery workers, only 30-40 are on duty currently while the rest are on unpaid leave. Many of the workers voluntarily chose to go on unpaid leave, said Adhikari.  “Due to the lack of transportation facilities, some employees could not come for work, while others didn’t want to work due to the fear of contracting the virus,” said Adhikari. To keep his business afloat, Adhikari’s company is providing salary to his employees on the basis of received orders.  Another problem that haunts the online food delivery business is confusion regarding transportation of goods. On March 25, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies had announced that online stores operating as per government regulations can make home deliveries of essential products after ensuring that they are following the safety protocols and their staff are outfitted with protective gear.  And online platforms have been following the guidelines put forth, said Adhikari. “We deliver food and vegetables by van and we make sure that the van is washed with disinfectant every day. We have also made sanitizer, gloves, and face masks available for our delivery boys and drivers,” he said. Along with sanitisation protocols, the platforms have also encouraged ‘contactless delivery’. Under the contactless delivery guideline, customers should prepay with the help of phone pay and online banking services such as eSewa and Khalti to prevent any form of physical contact. “We also recommend safe distance between the customers and delivery workers,” said Adhikari. However, an apparent lack of communication and coordination between the Ministry and the police in relaying information to online suppliers has created a lot of confusion. “Every day, at least one of our on-duty vans is taken under custody by the police on the pretext of not having a required travel document,” said Adhikari. “However, according to the government’s notice, being suppliers of essential products, we don’t need additional travel documents. There is clearly a lack of dissemination of information among the police,” said Adhikari, adding that due to such interference, they are losing on orders that are already few.  It is not only the food delivery companies that are facing the problems. Small and medium scale restaurants are also being affected by the strict transportation rules that have made it difficult to provide food delivery services. Jugal Thapa, 24, owner of Hangout’s Restro and Bar, which is located in Lalitpur, said that after the lockdown was declared, he had to immediately close his restaurant. In two months, he has already faced losses of around Rs 600,000. With nine employees to pay and Rs 95,000 as rent for his restaurant’s building, he decided to start delivering food to ensure some revenue was coming in. “I was feeling a little stable, since I was getting as many as 30 to 40 orders and was making around Rs 40,000 per day,” said Thapa. However, after the government announced to enforce the lockdown more strictly from May 15 with the rise in Covid-19 cases, Thapa said that he had to yet again halt his business. “The police are now not approving my travel document. For now, I have made an appeal to Lalitpur Metropolitan Office to grant me a travel document, specifying that I work for the food industry. But if I don’t get to continue my food delivery service, I may have to send some of my staff on unpaid leave,” said Thapa.  Although food delivery companies are now suffering immense loss, both Adhikari and Tiwari are hopeful that once the lockdown is lifted, there will be a rise in customer demand. But they also understand that there will be other complications.  “The restaurant industry, with which we work, will take time to recover even after the lockdown is lifted, which will affect us. We might also face the challenge of limited human resources since people may still be scared to work as delivery workers,” said Adhikari.

149,"Making Kanchemba, Thakali buckwheat fries, at home","May 8, 2020","I had my first taste of buckwheat fries, or ‘kanchemba’, at a Thakali restaurant in Pokhara a few years back. I went to the place for some dal bhat, rumoured to be one of the best in town. But then, I saw kanchemba on the menu. I had never heard of it before, and as new foods always excite me, I ordered the dish. Served with a timmur-chilli achaar, the fries didn’t have a pronounced flavour as such, but were delicious and kind-of addictive: crispy outside, but soft inside with a hint of buckwheat sweetness.  Buckwheat is a staple food of the Thakalis. If you visit Mustang in autumn, fields are covered with buckwheat flowering. Two varieties of buckwheat are grown in Nepal: common buckwheat (mithe phapar) and tartary buckwheat (tite phapar), with their characteristic bitter flavour. Common buckwheat is grown in all regions—the Tarai, Mid-hills, and the Himalayas, while tartary buckwheat is grown only in higher elevations because of its cold-resistant feature.  Thakalis make a variety of dishes from buckwheat flour, most commonly roti (unleavened pancake) and dhido or syangden (thick porridge). Buckwheat flour dumplings are cooked with dried mountain goat meat and vegetables to make soup known as alangkhu. Buckwheat flour batter is filled inside the mountain goat’s intestine to make a sausage-like dish known as dhong. Buckwheat greens are also consumed, usually in the winter. They are preserved for the cold by sun drying them, and are cooked with dried meat or blood sausage into soup called dhopra-khu.",Food,https://kathmandupost.com/food/2020/05/08/making-kanchemba-thakali-buckwheat-fries-at-home
150,Bikram Giri: Restaurants have two options—to close or inject enough funds to keep afloat,"April 8, 2020","Bikram Giri, chef and general manager of Manny's Eatery & Tapas Bar in Jawalakhel, never intended to become a chef. Growing up, Giri didn't particularly enjoy cooking, and when he started attending culinary classes, he hated it so much, he almost quit. But that was then. Giri has now spent nearly 20 years working in the foodservice industry. But cooking isn't the only thing Giri is known for. He is also known in his industry as the presenter and producer of an online talk show, The Voice of Chefs, which Giri started in 2018 to provide a platform for chefs in the country to share their stories and expertise.  In an interview with the Post's Tsering Ngodup Lama, Giri talks about his culinary journey, society's perceptions of cheffing as a profession, and the challenges the industry is facing due to Covid-19.   What made you get into cooking?  In our family, it was a tradition for the eldest son to join the army. My great grandfather, my grandfather, and father all served in the army. I was supposed to follow in their footsteps, but I never really liked the idea of becoming a soldier; mainly because I didn't like that my father was always away on duty and we never got to spend much time with him. But the problem was I had no idea what else to do with my life. That's where my uncle Narahari Giri came in. He was the one who told me about cooking as a profession and encouraged me to take cooking classes. He even told me chefs led a glamorous life, and that was all it took to convince me. In 2003, I signed up for a six-month culinary training course at Expansion Manpower Training Center, Kathmandu.  But you almost quit your training midway. Why? Culinary training wasn't easy. It didn't take long for me to realise that cooking as a profession was going to be tough. One day, I even went to my uncle and told him how I was finding the line of work very challenging, and he replied, ""Abhi nahin toh kabhi nahin"" (If not now then never). For reasons I still don't know, his words stuck in my head, and made me realise that I need to focus on cooking.  Gradually, I started becoming more serious and even started enjoying cooking.  The culinary industry is not known for being kind to newcomers. What was your initial experience in the industry like? I got my first taste of how the industry was to newcomers when I started my internship at Kathmandu Guest House, one of the leading hotels in the country. It was in 2003. As a trainee chef, I was treated like a second class citizen. On many occasions, I was even bullied, and instead of learning cooking, I spent a lot of my time doing other kitchen work. Back then, people were very secretive with their recipes and didn't share them with newcomers.  Luckily, the commis chef and I became good friends, and he took it upon himself to train me. But the difficult experiences of the initial days also taught me a lot and toughened me up. Not long ago, cheffing wasn't considered a respectable profession. How do you think the scenario has changed?  When I started this line of work, many friends laughed at my decision. They thought I was stupid. Even my parents weren't very happy about it. I don't blame them because, back then, cooking as a profession was something people did because they had no options. It wasn't deemed a 'respectable' profession. For many years, I hid the fact I cooked to make a living. Such was the taboo associated with the profession. The fact that the pay was paltry didn't help either.  But things have changed. Chefs are no longer looked down upon, and hundreds of youngsters go to culinary schools with hopes of becoming a chef one day. It's also no longer a low-paying job.  In 2018, you started The Voice Of Chefs as a platform to promote Nepali chefs and cuisine. What did you feel the need for such a platform? As a chef, I have had multiple opportunities to interact with some of Nepal's top chefs. Many of them would share their expertise and experiences with me, which I found very educational. One day, it struck me that if I could create a public platform and bring these experienced chefs to share their stories and knowledge, it would benefit many aspiring chefs. That was the aim behind The Voice of Chefs. So far, I have interviewed more than 100 chefs and promoted several local dishes and cuisines. On the show's first anniversary, we celebrated 27 of Nepal's leading chefs.  You have been in the foodservice industry for almost two decades now. How do you think the industry has improved over the years, and what are the areas you think that need improvement? Compared to 10 years ago, the industry has improved—a little. The country now has several international chain hotels, and many more are slated to come into operation soon. Another positive sign for the industry is that the culture of dining out is bigger than ever. But all that said, there are still many things lacking in the industry. Even though we have more multiple-star hotels, none of them have good restaurants dedicated to Nepali cuisine. There's also a dearth of institutions with the infrastructure and manpower needed to train students on authentic Nepali cuisine. And even though we have many great properties, I think they haven't been able to provide young chefs with the platform to learn and excel.  The lockdown has dealt an enormous blow to the country's restaurant industry. How long do you think it will take for the industry to recover?  As early as in January, long before the lockdown started, restaurants and hotels in the country had already started seeing a slump in business. By February, the footfall at restaurants and hotels had become negligible. Many restaurants were already facing trouble paying salaries, rent, and vendors. When the lockdown started, many employed in the sector had already lost their jobs and many were forced to take unpaid leave.

151,Butter-free chocolate chip cookies with wholemeal wheat flour,"April 2, 2020","When it comes to baking, there are a few things you need most often: butter, flour, eggs, sugar. Each of these play a vital role in creating delicious baked goods, and yes there are plenty of alternatives for the vegan, vegetarian, dairy-free and everything else-free people, but I was left at a loose end when trying to think about how to create cookies without using my flour and butter during this time of lockdown. I found recipes using olive oil, but that’s ludicrously expensive. Then I found there was a way to do it: with atta, wholewheat flour, and canola oil, thanks to Giora Shimoni at The Spruce Eats. And, being me, I decided to play around with it a little more. Playing around means more chocolate, and peanuts, and more chocolate. I also opted for a different type of oil, sunflower, and I divided the flour into two different types: barley and atta, and a little bit of cocoa. I would contend it would be possible to achieve this recipe with other types of flour too, but the barley flour adds a rather nice nutty flavour to the cookies.  The end result was magnificently soul-coddling, and reassuring, because who knows when butter is going to be easy to find again?  Ingredients:(Makes approximately three dozen cookies) 2 1/2 cups flour (whole wheat preferably; I used barley and whole wheat at 50-50)1 teaspoon baking powder1 tsp baking soda1/8 tsp salt2 large eggs3/4 cup sugar3/4 cup molasses sugar (a mix of chaakhu and gudd, crystalised)1 cup sunflower oil1 tablespoon vanilla essence/flavour (optional)1 cups chocolate chips1 cup salted peanuts Directions: Preheat oven to 190 C. Mix baking soda and powders, cocoa, and salt with flours in one bowl, and beat eggs and sugars until creamy in another. Add oil and vanilla to wet mixture and mix further before adding dry ingredients to wet batter in small batches. Mix just until smooth. Chop peanuts and stir in with chocolate chips. Take teaspoons of the mixture and roll into balls, placing on a greased oven tray. Flatten the balls a little. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until the cookies are set to your liking.  Once out of the oven, let the cookies cool on the pan before removing them to cool completely. Store in a sealed container.

152,Rikikur: The Sherpa potato pancake,"March 31, 2020","What’s better to make use of, other than potatoes during this lockdown? Many who are privileged enough may have a stock of potatoes in their kitchen. If you love cooking, try making this savoury potato pancake ‘rikikur’—a loved dish of Sherpa community. Potatoes are ingrained in Sherpa food culture, but it wasn’t always so. It was not until the mid 19th century that the potato was introduced to Sherpas in Khumbu, and it was not long until it became a staple. It contributed to the settled agrarian lifestyle and their economy—dried potatoes were even taken to Tibet to sell. From the Alps to the Himalayas of Nepal, the humble vegetable native to the South American Andes, helped communities like the Sherpa overcome famines, contributed to economic stability, and transformed their way of life. And, like those times, the humble tuber could be a saviour for hard times like now. In the Sherpa kitchen, the potato is as basic as it can get, and it is cooked in every imaginable way. Potatoes are made into pancakes, dumplings, soups, stews, mashed and were even turned into flour and alcohol in the past. Boiled potatoes served with spicy achaar is a typical mid-day snack for people working in the fields. Rikikur is a common breakfast dish for Sherpas. ‘Riki’ means potato and ‘kur’ is roti or bread in the Sherpa language, and the dish is just that: Finely grated potatoes mixed with a little flour and cooked in a pan. Traditionally, when modern graters weren’t available, rough surfaced stones were used as grater. Now, graters fashioned from steel plates are common in many a Sherpa family home. A spicy achaar, generally made from serkam (a solid product resulting from the boiling buttermilk), accompanies the pancake. When available, somar (fermented serkam) or soshim (fermented clotted cream)—is added to make the achaar extra flavourful. Like fish sauce, they have strong aroma but when added in sparingly, it plays a transformative role, elevating the entire dish. While it’s traditionally a breakfast dish, Rikikur can be eaten any time. The recipe is easy to make and doesn’t require a horde of ingredients. Also, when you have time during this lockdown, I encourage you to explore cuisines from across Nepal and teach yourself and kids about the importance of cooking.  Ingredients:  (Makes 4–5 rikikur) 8–10 potatoes, medium sized 3–4 tablespoons flour, buckwheat or plain white 1–2 eggs (optional) Butter or oil for frying For the achaar: 5–6 tbsps serkam, or thick yoghurt 1–2 stalks spring onion 3–4 cloves of garlic  1–2 green chillies 1 teaspoon salt Directions: Start with the achaar, if you don’t have serkam, use thick sour yoghurt instead. If the yoghurt is too thin, drain in a cotton cloth or large tea strainer until thick (approximately two hours). Grind spring onion, garlic, green chillies, and salt to make a paste, add to the yoghurt and mix. Wash and peel the potatoes before finely grating (a food processor can be used in lieu of a grater). The finer, the better. Add flour to the potatoes, and mix to form a batter. Flour helps in binding. Eggs can be added now, although it’s not a traditional recipe, as the proteins will help bind the mixture further. Avoid adding salt as it makes the pancake soggy by drawing moisture from the grated potatoes. ",Food,https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2020/03/31/rikikur-the-sherpa-potato-pancake

She had a tried and true banana cake that would always use old bananas from the freezer, carrot cakes when she wanted to appease my brother, and then there were her slices.  They were great for our lunches as kids, and there were two that I can taste when I think about them.

One of my family’ favourites is her chocolate-coconut slice, which she seems to be able to whip up in a jiffy, but I’ve always had a soft spot for her lemon slice. Now that I’m often fighting for space in the kitchen, I’ve taken her recipe and adapted it to add a little more texture.  That texture comes in the form of raisins and nuts, but should you feel you want to put white chocolate in there, perhaps some cardamom powder or a dose of dried apricots, then feel free.

160," Breaking the glass ceiling, one STEM class at a time","August 26, 2020","In 2009, when Binita Shrestha started her physics and computer science classes in high school, she was surprised to find herself to be the only girl in her class. But she didn’t make much of the situation and did not think that not having a female friend in the classroom would affect her much. “But I lost my confidence and I would hardly interact in the classroom,” says Shrestha. Because of a lack of female companions, she felt that she couldn't find a confidant, making her feel intimidated to put her views in the classroom, she says. “I used to question and self-doubt myself, whether I made the right decision of studying computer science,” she says. However, regardless of her struggle, she decided to pursue Information Technology in her Bachelor’s degree, where she met Pratiksha Pandey, a fellow student of her college, who was studying Electronic and Communication Engineering. Pandey, too, was one among three girls studying engineering in high school, and the absence of women’s participation had always bothered her too, she says. “It wasn’t like our [girl students] performance wasn’t up to mark. We were equally innovative and were scoring good marks,"" says Pandey. ""However the lack of female participation in my field always bugged me, as I understood that it wasn’t because women couldn’t fight in the competitive environment."" Both Shrestha and Pandey concluded with their experiences that it was societal expectations and gender stereotypes that were stopping women like them to study and make careers in the field of science, technology, engineering, maths (STEM). “We found that girls were told again and again that STEM wasn’t made for them, which discouraged them to even think about studying any STEM-related course,” says Shrestha. “Likewise, there wasn’t any visible role model in the field as well that aspiring girls could look up to.” And that’s when Shrestha and Pandey decided to start Women in STEM Nepal (WiSTEM Nepal), an initiative through which they would fill the gender gap as well as address the root of the problem by educating as well as teaching young girls about science and technology. Starting in 2016, the social enterprise, by collaborating with schools and various organisations, has been teaching young girls, between the ages of 10-25, computer-related courses along with creating an environment where they could aspire the girls to think of making a career in the STEM field. While the training sessions and the workshops last as per the interest shown by the school, on average the enterprise tries to teach the STEM-related curriculum according to the syllabus of the textbook in a manner that school-going students can easily grasp, says Shrestha. “From coding to design thinking and robotics, we try to teach the students how they can use STEM knowledge in real-life situations,” says Pandey. However, for young students, learning computer science can be tough, since they also have to study their regular school curriculum. And that’s where the enterprise does things differently. They have added 'A' to the curriculum, turning STEM into STEAM, in which the A means art. “We try to make sure that the curriculum we are teaching students are well-suited and are within their comfort zone. That’s why we use a lot of graphics, toys, games, and hands-on techniques, through which the children can learn more about STEM,” says Shrestha.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/08/26/breaking-the-glass-ceiling-one-stem-class-at-a-time
161,How do digital freelancers fare in Nepal? ,"August 11, 2020","Working online has been the norm for many of Nepal’s growing community of freelancers, an independent workforce who work as independent contractors for many of Nepal’s businesses, organisations, and events. Freelancing is nothing new and Nepal’s digital revolution has only helped propel the scope of the local freelance industry. Through the internet and a plethora of digital workspace tools, Nepal’s independent workforce has access to wider international and local networks that help them access far-flung clients and market themselves better.  Robic Upadhayay, 29, is a freelance photographer and documentary filmmaker freelancing for seven years. Having worked for many local development agencies and commercial clients, he says that most of his work still comes through traditional means, i.e. through word-of-mouth. He has worked for a few international clients as well, but those too he attributes to his strong local network instead of freelance marketplaces like Fiverr and Upwork. While Upadhayay doesn’t look for work online, he says that digital platforms like Behance and Instagram have helped him market himself better while also exposing him to potential work partners and clients. “While dealing with a potential client, I can use my portfolio [his Behance profile] to show them my work. I also use Instagram as a marketing tool, where I upload work images on my profile,” he says. “I have my own website as well, but social media is where I do most of my networking and connecting with clients.” And while social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn are all excellent platforms to build professional networks, there are dedicated digital services that provide a specific freelance marketplace. Among them, two of the most popular marketplaces are Fiverr and Upwork. Both these marketplaces play host to many Nepali freelancers peddling a variety of jobs: from graphic design, web development and translation jobs to the more outlandish digital rotoscoping and online medical consultation jobs. While a definite number for Nepali freelancers on both these sites is difficult to come by, a simple Nepal search on Upwork yielded pages of Nepali freelances that when quantified came down to more than 260 freelancers on the platform. Anurag Adhikari, 22, is one of the many Nepali freelancers featured on the platform. He started freelancing while pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Kathmandu University. Working as a part-time freelance for four years while he pursued his education, Adhikari continued to work independently for both international and local clients for a total of six years. “It’s not easy starting out as a freelancer,” Adhikari says. “Since you’re working independently, everything falls on you. You have to market yourself and be good at sales and communication. Entering the market inexperienced, I had a difficult time for the first two to three months because I couldn’t understand the industry very well. But after I got the hang of it, I started getting a lot of interest on Upwork and while I used to work for any client I was lucky enough to bag back then, I’ve room to be more selective and opt for clients that were more open to suggestions and were flexible time-wise.” And these jobs can sometimes be rewarding as well. Adhikari says he’s managed to earn $2,500 with a month’s job but these jobs don’t always come by. He says that there have been months where he didn’t earn anything. On average, he works with 15 to 20 clients a year. And 29-year-old Abiral Neupane, another Nepali freelancer of Upwork, echoes Adhikari. “I wouldn’t say freelance is lucrative,” says Neupane, who has managed to earn $2,000 on Upwork alone in the past two years of freelancing. “But it has given me a lot of spare time to invest in myself. You don’t have a boss and you don’t have managers to report to, your time is your own and as long as you meet the deadline, you can work as many hours and in as many chunks as you want. This freedom is more important,” he adds. Both Adhikari and Neupane agree. And while freelancing hasn’t been as lucrative as they’d hoped, they still think their earnings are higher than anything that they would’ve made working a traditional office job. But while more and more Nepali freelancers are flocking towards international clients, the problem of an international payment system seems to weigh down Nepali freelancers. Without a safe and efficient way to bring their earnings into the country, Nepali freelancers have had to resort to international digital wallets like PayPal and money transfer services like Payoneer. But even services like PayPal demand international credit card and banking details that many Nepali freelancers might not have access to. Apart from the payment difficulties, there is also a social stigma around freelance work. Sabrina Dangol, 26, a freelance photographer, videographer and video editor working independently since 2015, says, “That initial plunge is always difficult to make. You are trading safety for uncertainty and that will definitely ring alarm bells not only for you personally, but for your parents as well. It was difficult for me to convince my parents because it was difficult for them to understand.” This type of social stigma seems to be prevalent beyond personal spaces too. Dangol says how people already have a stereotype around freelancers which translates to the lack of respect clients have for their work. “While international clients are relatively better, local clients try to bargain with you as if you’re selling vegetables in Lagankhel. In Nepal, clients usually are unaware of what they want from the freelance artist and some ask for way too much under a strict budget. And even when you do find a middle point and you get the work done, payments are regularly delayed,” she says. Upadhayay agrees. He says, “Even some of the reputed clients I have worked with have delayed payments while some have not paid me the amount we agreed upon. Some have even defaulted on the payment even when the due deliverables have been submitted in the agreed schedule. There have been times when I have actually spent more time following up on payment than working on a project. This just shows how legal provisions aren’t in place to ensure security for freelance workers like us.” Issues like these seem to be less of a problem with international clients and digital marketplaces following strict rules of professionalism. Adhikari says that his payments from Fiverr and Upwork have never been delayed. But while payment might not be a problem for Nepali freelancers while working with international clients, problems like time differences and language barriers definitely are. Neupane says that he’s had to wake up in the middle of the night to attend meetings with his international clients and sometimes due to the language barrier, some of the important bits get lost in translation. But most importantly, Neupane says that freelance work can be very isolating. “While you have the freedom to work at any time and anywhere, it can get quite lonely,” he says. “Working on your computer with very minimal human interaction can get very boring which is why you have to keep yourself motivated to work and exercise self-discipline and -control. You can get very lazy when left to your own devices.” The digital revolution has opened up various doors for Nepali freelancers to work with and collaborate with international clients while making it easier to find local clients as well.

His company, Paaila Technology, which focuses on the development of robotics and artificial intelligence, was at the top of their game. The company had just launched a robot service at the Tribhuvan International Airport that would greet passengers. They were also making banking robots while simultaneously working on making chatbots for various businesses to offer a quick solution to customer inquiries.  For this group of innovators, 2020 was a promising year. However, by the beginning of March, things started changing. As the number of Covid-19 cases rose, the government announced a nation-wide lockdown, which meant their company had some urgent rethinking to do. “We were starting to think about how we as a tech company could be part of a solution to mitigate the crisis the world was having,” says Giri, who is also the head of robotics at Paaila Technology. By this point, global news was rife with the shortage of ventilators, an appliance for artificial respiration. There weren’t enough ventilators for patients of Covid-19 and people were dying. In Italy, amid the outbreak of the virus, doctors were being made to choose which patients should get the machines to help them breathe. That was when Giri thought of creating ventilators. Soon, he was discussing its possibility with his executive team. “We had the technical capacity to make ventilators, and we decided to go ahead and start making them,” says Giri.  “If big, powerful countries did not have enough ventilators, imagine what the situation would be for a country like Nepal if there were to be a major outbreak,” says Aayush Kasajoo, the executive director and co-founder of the company.  The following days, with just half their total number of staff, because of the country lockdown, the Paaila team invested all their time to understand and develop a prototype. The team worked closely with biomedical engineers and medical professionals day and night, and in 20 days, the company was ready with a prototype that weighed 25 kgs. It was a simple Ambu bag-based ventilator that could assist initial respiratory support to any patient with respiratory failure. It also had a USP support for power back up, and a monitoring screen that could give the graph readings to doctors besides buttons that could control inspiratory: expiratory ratio, respiratory rate, minute volume and pressure limitations.  “The device, of course, cannot replace the ICU ventilator, as it's a very simplified ventilator. But it can definitely assist in acute respiratory distress syndrome cases. Our product is particularly oriented towards the times we are living in,” says Sagar Shrestha, head of product development at Paaila Technology.  The team, however, also believes, in a country like Nepal, where health centres and medical institutions still do not have adequate ventilators, their product can be of great service to patients who require immediate respiratory care, especially in the rural areas. The company has successfully developed mainly three types of ventilators, which have received the green light from medical professionals at Bir Hospital, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital and Dhulikhel Hospital. A team of anesthesiologists from Dhulikhel Hospital, in a report, also acknowledged appreciation for their hard work and have also been working with the team to improve and upgrade the ventilators. At Dhulikhel, their ventilator was also tested against the standard ventilators to check the device’s calibration, accuracy and parameter. “For the certification process from the Ministry of Health, we have tested our devices in a trauma centre. The centre has given us some feedback, and we are currently working on that. Once that is done, we can help Covid-19 patients,” says Shrestha.  The young innovators also believe at a time like this, Nepal can benefit a lot from local manufacturing companies, more so because imports of products will be difficult and costly. “Right now the whole world is struggling and we live in a situation where countries first have to be able to help themselves. So, I think our ventilators can be very useful,” says Binay Raut, CEO and co-founder of Paaila Technology.  Besides coming up with ventilators, Paaila Technology has also developed nursing robots and ultraviolet disinfectants. “The nursing robots are an adaptive tweak to our navigating robots to fit the needs of our time when social distancing is mandatory,” says Shrestha.  For the company, the main challenge right now, however, is getting materials needed to increase production, as the lockdown and the restrictions on flights have created a shortage of required materials. But before they get into production, they need the go-ahead from the government, which is currently in the works. Seeing the potential of their machines, the government has been running trial runs of their products in trauma centres under the supervisions of doctors. The company is also working with the government to make guidelines for using the product and is pacing towards certification of their ventilators from the Ministry of Health.  “It’s very encouraging to see their motivation,” says Dr Khem Karki, a health expert and advisor at the Ministry of Health and Population. “However, we are still working on making standards to approve their work. We don’t have a legal regulatory body yet in the country to license such work. And therefore to help them, we first need to expand our capacity and need to compare with a standard that can say that their appliances can be used to save human lives,” says Karki.  While matters of approval can impede the project, Paaila in the meantime hopes to get clearance from the Medical Association and Nepal Medical Council for their ventilators.

163,Games to play during lockdown,"April 14, 2020","The lockdown is likely to continue. While many are home doing productive things like learning a new instrument, upping their cooking skills and getting back to reading, there are many among us who find it tough to do anything productive in a stressful situation like this. During such times, one of the best ways to distract your mind is to dive into games. While there are many games that will completely engage you and keep your mind off other things, I’ve decided to add some criteria before making a list. The first rubric is longevity. Since we will be indoors for a while, before all of this becomes normal, it would make sense to play a game that will take a substantial time to complete. The other is how much value you get from the game. Lastly, how popular the game actually is.  What’s great is some of these games are quite cheap, available digitally on both PlayStation and Xbox. If you don’t own a console, some of these games are also available on PC. Red Dead Redemption 2 Ever since Red Dead Redemption 2’s release in 2018, it’s been dubbed the best looking game ever made. The game surpasses Grand Theft Auto V which, since its release in 2013, is still played by loads today. The story is compelling, gripping and the game play is smooth. The characters are strong and will be with you days after you complete the game. The people at Rockstar have put a lot of effort in the details. If you stare at a person you’ve shot, you’ll see the body decay. Horses, if not fed or given water, will become tired and lose weight. Another interesting point is you have to hunt to craft items. And, surprise surprise, it’s not easy. It’ll take a lot of practice and by the time you get a hold of how to do it, you can kill a bear with one strike. It’s a game that takes you outside while you’re indoors. The sheer number of hours it will take to complete the game will make it worth it. The fact you can play this online makes it a game everyone needs to play. Grand Theft Auto V The fifth edition of Grand Theft Auto is timeless. It’s a game you can play over and over again. Firstly, the game has a great story. You can play as three characters. All of them are unique in their own way. Experiencing the game from three different perspectives allows you to truly enjoy the diversity the game offers. Secondly, its multiplayer option gives people the chance to play with friends. Even though it was released in 2013, there are still updates through which you can enjoy the game in newer ways. For those who play the game on the PC, they can add mods to the game and play the game differently. There are mods which can change cars and some can even convert the characters into the likes of Thanos or Iron Man, or you can apply a mod which can submerge the setting of Los Santos underwater making it like Atlantis. For console users, don’t worry, you can still have fun driving your favourite car, going to bars and clubs too, and if you’re interested, you can even play golf or tennis. If you’re bored with the story mode, play it online or race. God of War 4 For PlayStation owners, this is a must-play. It’s challenging. You have to be smart, cunning and skillful. And even if you do that, you might still struggle. If you’ve played other versions of God of War, you’ll relate to everything its main character Kratos says. It raises questions about sacrifice, struggle and family. It makes you more emotional than it previously did. The storyline is simple. Like previous editions, Kratos has to fight and kill his way through the world of Norse mythology. But this time he’s not alone. He was accompanied by his son Atreus. The story is not what makes it stand out; the gameplay does, which is why a lot of people have called it the game of the generation. It’s a perfect mixture of puzzles, combat, storytelling and exploration. If you haven’t played it already, you have been missing out. Bloodbourne Probably the toughest game on the list, Bloodbourne will test everything—your intelligence, your ability and your patience. It’s a game not for the faint hearted. The game has just no option for a difficulty level and that makes the game even better. It’s honest and for many who’re not used to playing soul games, be sure you will have a hard time. But by the end of it, you’ll surely appreciate what you’ve done because not many will have done what you have. The game will also teach you a lot about melee fighting. Because you have to dodge attacks like you’re playing a UFC game with primitive weapons. It might be easy to do so with the normal enemies, but you’re going to need a lot of responsive skills to get through the level bosses.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/04/14/games-to-play-during-lockdown
164,Tap into these apps to optimise remote working,"March 24, 2020","Many local businesses, organisations, and institutions have started implementing work-from-home policies to support social distancing efforts, to combat the rapid spread of Covid-19. And in tiring times like these, the concept of remote work has turned into a necessity rather than a luxury. But as more and more workforces move towards collaborative technologies, these technologies can be difficult for organisations as well as individuals to adopt. While more popular systems by Facebook, Skype and Google Office web applications might be the go-to tool for many local organisations, now is the perfect time to experiment with new collaborative technologies with a distinct focus on remote working.  Here we take a look at some digital systems that could be useful to both individuals and organisations while facilitating and managing remote work.  SlackSlack is an email-replacement and messaging tool that aims to replace internal emails with department-based channels. The central philosophy of Slack is that instead of sending out individual emails to specific people within a department, short messages can be dropped inside departmental channels that everyone from a specific group can view while also enabling managers to keep track of conversations and work happening within a specific department. Slack is also jam-packed with features that help team-based communication with support for emojis, ‘reacjis’, and embedded images and files. Slack also has great video and audio-conferencing features for digital team meetings although there are better alternatives for conference calls.Slack has a free option but also features two paid tiers: Standard and Plus. Standard packages are $8 per person and Plus packages are $15. Slack is definitely not cheap, but is one of the best team messaging apps out there that can truly replace traditional emails with a more social and interactive messaging system.  AsanaAsana is a full-fledged office on the cloud. At its core, Asana is a team management software that offering a host of features for remote work. The application supports brainstorming, calendar management, contact management, content management, discussion boards, document management, project management, real-time editing and task management systems. If you’re managing larger teams working remotely, Asana helps bring everyone together on one platform. Although Asana is great for team and project management, it misses some core features essential for managers, like job costing and resource management.Asana is free for a team of less than 15 people. But if you want more features and support for a workforce larger than that, the Premium tier costs $11 per month per user while the more feature-rich Business tier costs $24 per month per user. While expensive, if you’re looking for a complete digital workspace for remote workers, there aren’t many better alternatives than Asana, although Bitrix24 is a close second. InVisionInVision is a prototyping platform focused on design and development. Service-based and prototype design organisations will benefit greatly from the features of this service. The platform enables seamless communication between designers, clients and managers. InVision enables creatives to upload their projects onto the platform where clients and managers can easily tag certain elements, comment on any part of the design and also send individual messages to the creative team. The platform also supports ideation phases where collaborative discussions can take place before the actual work takes place. For web development teams, InVision also helps bridge the gap between the front- and back-end developers by providing developers with the ability to inspect and pull HTML, CSS and icons straight from the prototype rather than asking the designer to slice everything for web development.InVision is free for one project, $15 gives you access to three simulation projects and $25 will give you access to an unlimited number of projects at the same time. ZoomVideo conferencing is one the most important cornerstones for remote work, and team and project meetings are a necessity in any kind of professional workspace. Skype for Businesses has always been the go-to service for conference calls, but while Skype is great, Zoom is better. Zoom offers better HD conferencing calls, meeting minutes and is even a bit easier on the wallet. But amidst a slew of disconnected callers, poor video or crackling audio, Zoom’s biggest selling point still remains its stability. It’s hard to put a price on a service that just works. Zoom also lets users call into a meeting via a toll-free phone number depending on service availability while enriching the experience by providing hosts with the ability to share documents, share their screens across meeting clients and even know when the Zoom window is not active on a client’s computer. For free, Zoom lets you host up to 100 people for 40 minutes while also providing unlimited one-to-one meetings. There are paid plans as per organisations’ needs starting from $15/host to $20/host.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/03/24/tap-into-these-apps-to-optimise-remote-working
165,The best gaming laptops money can buy,"March 17, 2020","It is a known fact that gaming and content creation requires a powerful computer. While it is preferable to assemble a personal computer or just buy one, these options are not suitable for everyone. Some content creators might need their system to be portable while a gamer might want to use his computer from something other than gaming. But how does one choose a laptop? Which one is the best? Here’s where we can help: Alienware Area-51m When it comes to powerful laptops, there aren’t many which come close to Alienware. The Alienware Area-51m has been dubbed by many as an out-of-this-world gaming laptop. To start with, the laptop is extremely powerful. Equipped with an Intel Core i9-9900K processor, 32GB of memory (64 GB also available), 1TB of solid-state drive (SSD) storage, a 1TB solid-state hard drive (SSHD) and a desktop-class Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080, it’s the best gaming laptop money can buy in 2020. Add to that, it is widely user upgradeable. That is not it, unlike other Alienware laptops, this is aesthetically pleasing too. It comes in two colours, Lunar Light (white) and Dark Side of the Moon (black), and both options are jaw-dropping—looks wise. This laptop features a beautiful, clean design, and while it’s definitely huge, it doesn’t look like an edgy toy. You won’t feel the need to hide this laptop when people come over. On the contrary, you’d want to show it off. One thing that’s going to put people off the product is its price. There are four options one can buy and the price range is between $3,100 to $5,000 (that’s approximately Rs368,000- Rs593,000). Another downside is that the system does heat up quite fast. Even though it does have good fans, it’s a bit loud and distracting—particularly if you’re concentrating to edit a video or are stuck in a really difficult phase of a game. It’s also quite heavy. At nearly nine pounds, you’re not going to take it everywhere with you.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/03/17/the-best-gaming-laptops-money-can-buy
166,Poco X2: A worthy addition to the Poco family,"March 10, 2020","Xiaomi made a splash back in 2018 with their micro-brand Pocophone. The Pocophone F1, released mid-2018, was a phone that everyone wanted. It featured powerful hardware, a modern aesthetic and came at an affordable price point. The device was a hit in India and even in Nepal, many Nepali consumers bought the device through Daraz’s exclusive online release. For Xiaomi and Poco, the F1 was a huge success becoming one of Xiaomi’s best selling phones with 700,000 units sold by the end of 2018. Part of the success of the brand was also because it catered to consumer needs by undercutting their competitors—similar devices with a Snapdragon 845 processor went to more than double the price of the F1. Even the after-market support of the F1 has been phenomenal. Poco has released timely upgrades reflected with an Android 10 upgrade from their initial Android 8.0 at the time of release. Considering just how beloved the Poco brand has been for mid- to low-range consumers, Poco fans have been awaiting the release of the predecessor to the F1, the F2 for years. And while Poco still hasn’t followed up on their flagship device, they recently released a mid-ranged device that still undercuts their competitors and offers specifications that, in some cases, even blow their flagship out of the water.  Dubbed the Poco X2, the device was officially launched in India mid-February of this year. The brand-new device features recent hardware like the Snapdragon 730G chipset, which although not as powerful as Snapdragon’s higher-end 800 series, is a very reliable and competent mid-ranged chip. Since the 730G is a mid-ranged processor, it is extremely efficient which means that it’s going to use far less power than the more power-hungry processors of the 800 series. The 730G is an octa-core processor with CPU clusters, six efficient 1.8 Ghz cores and two powerful 2.2 Ghz Kyro 470 cores. Paired with the very competent Adreno 618 GPU, the phone is more than capable of handling graphic-intensive workloads easily. The base variant also comes with ample 6GB of RAM with the most expensive variant offering 8GB. The X2 offers similar specifications to the F1 except the high-performing CPU core, but regardless of the chipset specifications, the X2 also offers peripheral features that are lacking on the F1. The X2 offers an amazingly fast 120Hz display, is equipped to handle 27W of fast charging and has an insane 64MP Sony IMX686 camera sensor with an additional four cameras to support smartphone photography. Powering all of this is a massive 4,500 mAh battery.  Okay, the Poco X2 definitely looks good on paper, but what about physical aesthetics and usability? The Poco F1 too suffered from build-quality issues that many consumers looked past because of the low-price point. While the Poco F1 featured a subdued design that didn’t really draw much attention, the X2 is flashy. Gone is the flimsy, cheap looking plastic build of the F1. The X2 is all metal, plastic and glass. A plastic mid-frame is sandwiched between two Gorilla Glass 5 panels that not only provide improved scratch resistance but also contributes to the structural integrity of the phone. The curved-edges helps the ergonomics of the phone since it tapers inside the corners of your palm, providing a confident grip even though the slippery glass back is a cause for concern here. Poco is branding the X2 as a phone for gamers. And in many ways, it delivers exceptional gaming performance. The 120Hz display comes in handy during gameplay since gamers will have that slight edge of faster response times. A faster display is not something that even many higher-end phones offer, so the fast screen is a much-appreciated addition to the X2. For long gaming sessions, the X2 comes with a well-implemented liquid-cooling system that keeps heat-levels of the 730G at bay, but even with good cooling, the phone gets quite warm when the phone is pushed hard. The 730G is definitely not as capable as the processor on the F1, but Snapdragon has specifically built the 730G with gaming in mind, so even with a mid-ranged processor you can expect a fluid gaming experience across all kinds of games.  For a gaming phone, the X2 has some really interesting optics. The 64MP sensor acts as the main camera supported by a 8MP wide-angle. Furthering the capabilities of these two cameras are two additional 2MP sensors, one detecting depth and one detecting macro focus. These optics, when paired with Xiaomi’s Camera AI, produce some of the most vibrant and colourful photos when compared to other devices in this price-range. The additional wide-angle also comes as a welcome addition since the F1 didn’t come with any wide-angle support. Night mode, however, is still hit-or-miss with the camera producing some beautiful shots at night to unusably grainy and saturated photos.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/03/10/poco-x2-a-worthy-addition-to-the-poco-family
167,What you need to know about ethical hackers in Nepal,"March 3, 2020","In August last year, Nepal Police arrested five Chinese nationals for ATM fraud. The Chinese, Zhu Lianang and four others, were apprehended by the police for using cloned debit cards to breach multiple banks’ processing system and withdrawing cash from 68 ATMs. Police confiscated Rs12.60 million and around $10,000 along with 132 forged VISA debit cards, 17 authentic VISA cards, six mobile phones, a laptop and a data card from them. According to police, Zhu and his accomplices had hacked the Nepal Electronic Payment Systems (NEPS), an interface that allows the transaction of money deposited in a bank by using cards issued by other member banks. Banks falling prey to hackers isn’t new to Nepal. In November 2017, NIC Asia Bank suffered a hack attack that led to attackers issuing fraudulent money transfers via the SWIFT interbank messaging service. The bank said that attackers initiated $4.4 million in fraudulent money transfers from its accounts to accounts in six other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Singapore. Both the incidents have shed light to how weak Nepal’s cyber security is. The incidents have also forced banks and other big corporations to hire cyber-security experts to ensure that if and when such things happen, they have the right person to deal with the issue. The people they have been hiring are ethical hackers. The failure of banks, especially the central Nepal Rastra Bank, to upgrade their digital security measures has meant that Nepal is increasingly becoming a target for hackers from around the world. But it’s not just banks that are in danger. In addition to cash-out attacks, weak systems are vulnerable to conventional attacks using phishing software and malware, and physical methods like ATM jackpotting. What is ethical hacking? Ethical hacking can be defined as the practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. “It happens after the company that owns the system or network allows cyber security experts to test the system’s defences,” says Samir Gautam, an independent security analyst. “Unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and more importantly, legal.” Gautam says that ethical hackers aim to check the company’s system or network for weak points. “That way we get to know if the system can be exploited or not,” he says. The purpose of ethical hacking, according to experts, is to improve the security of the network or systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing. What is an ethical hacker’s job? “We use the same methods that a hacker uses. We try to find out what is wrong and how it can be solved,” says Shailendra Basnet, founder of IT Training Nepal, a computer institute based in Kathmandu. “An ethical hacker’s job is to improve the security and defend the system from attacks by malicious users.” Gautam says that Nepali organisations started to hire security experts around 2014. But the need for them intensified after the NIC Asia incident in 2017. Prior to this, hacking was never considered a big threat because there was no actual incident where any organisation lost money. “It’s about quantitative assessment rather than qualitative when it comes to big corporations in Nepal. That makes Nepal quite prone to international hacking. But things are getting better. Banks are more vigilant as they don’t want to leak money as well as their client’s information. But we need to do more,” says Gautam. By more, Gautam means companies need to regularly update the software they use and to hire and retain qualified staff members. “It’s small things like these that are the reason that can stop cyber hacking. Nepal has just begun to go digital. Our details are going online more than it used to, which is why ethical hacking is important. It keeps us on our toes and keeps us safe,” says Gautam. To ensure that cyber security is taken seriously, various hacking events/conferences have also started taking place in Nepal. One such conference is Threat Con organised by a security analysing company Threat Nix, which has been taking place annually since 2018. “The aim is to talk about the importance of cyber security and how we can prepare ourselves right now,” says Abiral Shrestha, security analyst at ThreatNix. Shrestha says that these events expose Nepali companies to the risk that they might have to face in the future. He says that Nepal currently is in a delicate situation, with everything going digital, from national identity cards to driving licenses, and if the country is not careful, it could invite in a lot of risks related to data security. Who provides such services in Nepal? Gautam shares that there are various companies in Nepal which offer ethical hacking services. Laba Nepal, Vairav Technology and Cryptogen have been in operation for nearly a decade. “These companies give an individual the skills required to become an ethical hacker. They provide them the knowledge of programming, networking skills and a general understanding of databases. If I were a company, I would hire two of these companies—one would hack and the other would try to block the hack. That is how you could create a safe cyberspace,” says Gautam. Colleges, after seeing a rise in demand for courses which deal with cyber security, are also adding courses on the topic, says Shrestha, who was interested in computer security from a young age, and thus completed his bachelor’s degree in Computer Networking and Cyber Security from Islington College. “It’s great that colleges are offering courses like these. There is a huge demand for skilled people in the security sector in Nepal and this is just the start,” says Shrestha. Gautam feels it’s a booming market which can be both a good thing and a bad thing. But for now, he hopes all organisations keep up with what is happening and invest in better software and systems.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/03/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-ethical-hackers-in-nepal
168,The future of foldable smartphones,"February 25, 2020","Smartphones have evolved rapidly in terms of technology over the years. But their look has largely remained intact: glass on plastic, metal or glass bodies. No matter how expensive or how cheap your phone, they all look exactly alike.  But in 2019, an evolution in the aesthetics of the smartphone came in the form of bezel-less screen designs, which were quickly adopted by the lower- and mid-range phones due to the simplicity of its execution and the overall development of screen technology. With these screens, gone were the days of big, bulky LCD displays with thinner implementations of the same technology alongside completely different technology, like LED.  As display technology started shedding its weight, smartphone manufacturers started experimenting with new formfactor devices. Now, in 2020, we are seeing the first commercial implementation of screens and, by effect, smartphones that can fold. These new foldable phones have already redefined the way traditional smartphones look with some that fold inwards, some that fold outward and even some that fold top-down.  On the cusp of 2020, the future of smartphones looks diverse, not only internally but aesthetically as well. Samsung is leading this innovation by introducing two foldable smartphones: the Galaxy Fold and the Galaxy Z Flip. Motorola is also banking on the popularity of their most successful flip phone, the Moto Razr, and has introduced a revised version of the phone with the folding screen. Then there’s Huawei, different from all the others with an outward folding screen, with the Huawei Mate X. All of these devices are extremely expensive at the moment, owing to the complexity of their design, engineering and components; which means only the wealthiest of early adopters can get a hold of these phones, but the main question surrounding these devices right now is: “Is it consumer ready?” In many ways, no. All these smartphones have their own share of issues that might not appeal to general smartphone users in their current state. This is primarily because of the engineering complexity around foldable phones and the feature set that consumers have come to associate with flagship phones. Many manufacturers are struggling with the engineering around their folding mechanisms since moving parts inside a smartphone open the floodgates to many issues that could arise during normal everyday use. Screens too have failed in many instances because of the early nature of the technology.  One of the earliest examples of the issues that arise with foldable phones can be seen with the implementation of the Samsung Galaxy Fold. Initially released in October 2019, the initial units of the Fold were plagued with critical display failures. Reviewers started peeling off a protective plastic layer on top of the ultra-thin foldable display which turned out to be critical to its function. Many users of the phone complained the screen literally died after they peeled off the plastic layer, condemning Samsung for releasing a product without any warning labels or safety features in place. Samsung has released a revised version of the phone with a protective bezel around the layer to dissuade users from peeling off the screen.  Since these screens fold in various ways, there also seem to be issues around visible creases around stress points. The Fold has a crease running right down the middle of the screen while phones like the Z Flip and the Moto Razr flaunt one right across the middle. Users went into a fury around notches during the earlier days of bezel-less displays, imagine what kind of a response an intrusive centre crease is going to prompt. While companies have been trying to reduce the visibility of creases, none of them have been successful. No matter how dim the crease may be, they’re going to pop-out like a sore-thumb on dark and bright screens.  Another major problem around folding screens is the folding mechanism. Since the screens can’t fold flush and they require at least a little bit of flex on stress points, this pushes folding mechanisms to make space for the screen to fold inside, or outside, the mechanism itself. In many instances of these mechanisms, they open up spaces of dirt, grime and small particles to make their way inside the folding mechanism. In JerryRigEverything’s durability test video (on YouTube) on the Razr, a pebble lodged itself behind the folding screen due to the way it folded, leaving open spaces around the hinges when it did. Samsung, in the Z Fold, tried to mitigate this issue by placing bristles around the folding mechanism to catch dust particles, but in a dust test by iFixIt (again, on YouTube) that put these bristles to the test, they found it almost useless in keeping dust out of fine moving gears. Owning a phone with the ability to open and close also comes with their fair share of problems that traditional slab phones might have already engineered out. Foldable phones can’t be water resistant since the folding mechanisms will always leave gaps through which water can find its way in. Screens will also not feel as premium as your slab phones, since folding glass has its own share of engineering complexities; although the Z Flip does feature a foldable glass display, many issues like visible glass shards still plague them. Even in the Z Flip, however, a plastic protection layer sits on top of the glass which mitigates many of the benefits of glass like scratch resistance and hardness.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/02/25/the-future-of-foldable-smartphones
169,Southeast Asian regional symposium on microbial ecology held,"February 18, 2020","A three-day Southeast Asian regional symposium on microbial ecology, organised by Microbial Ecology Network Nepal concluded in Pokhara. The symposium was organised with an objective to strengthen microbial ecology research network in Southeast Asia by laying focus on the integrated sustainability of environment, biodiversity and the microbes.

170,'Trash can' to 'cheese grater': Powerful new Mac Pro is no joke,"January 27, 2020","For six years, Apple has refused to update its Pro line of computers. Ever since the “trash can” Mac was introduced in 2013, creative professional dedicated to the Apple eco-system suffered performance impacting thermal performance, while also getting limited by sub-par hardware. For years, Apple offered the horribly engineered trash can-shaped Mac as their highest spec professional Mac, which forced many to move from Mac to PC workstations, which provided them the horsepower and customisability they needed. Answering the prayers of many professionals, Apple released a redesigned Mac Pro towards the end of 2019. With the refreshed design, Apple went all out, chucking out the small, compact, consumer-focused design of 2013 for a massive tower weighing a hefty 18 kilograms. Following classic Apple design, the new Mac Pro is built completely out of aluminum and stainless steel with a cheese grater air-inflow design harkening back to the original 2006 Mac Pros. Like all Apple products, the Mac Pro is designed extremely well, and even over-engineered in some aspects. The aluminum chassis comes off as one single piece, providing full 360-degree access to all the computer’s internal components. Held together by a single circular latch atop the frame, the Mac Pro is really simple to get into. All the internal components are also held together by well-designed latches and access to all of the computer’s internal components are easily user-replaceable and -upgradable. This comes as a welcome surprise to Apple fans who have been locked into factory specifications through soldered-in internal components. Apple’s atrocious approach to repairability and upgradability has been a constant problem for professionals who wanted access to leading components that resided outside of Apple’s hardware offerings.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/01/27/trash-can-to-cheese-grater-powerful-new-mac-pro-is-no-joke
171,Cameras for amateur photographers,"January 21, 2020","Photography has picked up in Nepal recently. People spend hours trying to get the perfect shots around the country, and if you ask anyone on the street what their hobby might be, the answer will often be photography. Some say cameras teach people how to see, to look, and to absorb their surroundings, without a camera. But to be or become a photographer, the most important thing you need is a camera—although, choosing the right camera before you start is not as easy as it sounds. Choosing a camera is like choosing a friend, and it is recommended you avoid bundled deals and go for separate bodies and lenses. Treat the cameras like a long-term investment.  Here we have listed four cameras under US $1000 which can be perfect for all hopeful photographers: Canon EOS 750D",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/01/21/cameras-for-amateur-photographers
172,The biggest tech flops of the decade,"January 14, 2020","The last decade has inspired technological advances that drastically changed the way we interact with technology. We saw electric vehicles popularise and flourish with Tesla’s Model X series, we experienced successful real-world implementation of augmented reality through Pokémon Go, and we saw online gaming ascend new heights through games like PUBG and Fortnite. But where some succeeded, others failed. While many companies experienced many technological successes over the past decade, they have also been marred by their fair share of flops. We celebrated many of the 2019’s successes in the last article, so let’s take a look at some of the most iconic fails of the past 10 years. After all, the path to success is always littered with mistakes. Hyperloop Tech visionary Elon Musk’s vision of the transportation of the future came with quite the hype. The hyperloop was supposed to transport passengers across long distances at speeds of over 1000 kilometres per hour. The idea was to send passenger pods, each housing around 28 passengers each, through a vacuum tube using electromagnetic propulsion. Conceptualised by Musk in 2012, the idea of the hyperloop had permitted the imagination of Silicon Valley experts by 2013, with everyone keeping a close eye on the developments of the transport of the future.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/01/14/the-biggest-tech-flops-of-the-decade
173,When science and art meet to create designs,"January 7, 2020","When we think about art, we usually envision the paint and canvas. But Kushal Pokharel uses technology to make art. With the help of software he created, which he has named Symbiosis, he generates patterns from a number of references he curates. He then customises and creates hundreds of different patterns or artforms.  “The designs are created by the software. It’s basic programming. But I use different apps and software to create the design,” says Pokharel. “I like to call it example based installation art.” In order to train the software to create a design, he has curated over 100,000 designs and patterns, which has given him a general idea of whether the design is good or bad.  Take the example of two colours—red and yellow. The software creates a structure where the colours are mixed with one another to create abstract art. Some make sense, some don’t. Pokharel says he has made around 1,500 designs manually in the past year and is working on his software to do the same. “I want to have at least 100,000 designs so that when a design opportunity comes, I can sell it and the buyer will have plenty of options to choose from,” he says.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2020/01/07/when-science-and-art-meet-to-create-designs
174,A look back at 2019’s tech,"December 31, 2019","As we venture into 2020, the technological advances of 2019 act as a guiding light to the advances we might see in the upcoming year. The past year has brought some very interesting advancements in consumer technology that has and will continue to define the path that technology is going to take in the future. These technologies have not only changed the way we interact with tech today but have also changed the way the infrastructure around our devices function. Here we take a look at some of the most important consumer technological advances that have defined the past year and should further influence and guide consumer tech in the upcoming year. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing In the past year, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become more ubiquitous than ever before. Smartphones now come with dedicated AI chips that aid in various implements like photography, virtual assistants and data processing. Through the use of complicated AI technologies, smartphone companies like Huawei, Samsung and Google have managed to push night mode photography to such an extent that the camera software will automatically fill in light—based on machine learning algorithms to create bright images in environments with minimal light. A good example of this would be the night modes in Huawei’s P30 Pro and Samsung Note 10 Plus. Even smaller smartphone manufacturing companies have implemented some form of AI to further support their camera systems. Natural Language Processing has also entered the consumer market this year with digital translation devices. Waverly Labs currently sells their Pilot earbuds that act as language translators which currently work with 15 different languages and 42 dialects. Syncing with your phone, the earbuds also send text transcripts to your phone in case you miss anything. Supplementing translation devices, Google has also introduced its voice-to-text transcription service on the latest version of its Android operating system. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality We talk about the immense potential of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) each year but have yet to see the effective implementation of both these technologies in consumer space. Google Lens didn’t pan out as well as consumers hoped and even promising VR technologies of the past like Oculus and HTC Vive have yet to find a good foothold in the consumer space. Why then do we keep talking about AR and VR as important technologies every year? Well, while being disruptive, the tech also holds enormous potential in changing the way we interact with technology. And while VR and AR in its infancy found implementation in bulky and unruly devices, more refined implementations have been pushed in 2019. Focals 2.0 by North is one such example where all of the AR technology has been hidden away inside the frames of the eyewear, which reflects a maturity of the technology unseen in earlier implementations of the technology like Google Glass, with its ugly protruding AR element. Even in Nepal, companies like Semantic Creations and PaperLift AR have been experimenting, improving and furthering the VR and AR technologies with a local Nepali flavour. Electric Automobiles While the electric propulsion technology is not exclusive to 2019, the surge of electric vehicles in Nepal adopted by many denizens in the city is. In 2019, we have seen wide adoption of electric vehicles by companies like Niu scooters and Kia’s Soul EV cars. And with smarter development of electric vehicle technology, many Nepalis are hopping aboard such zero-emission vehicles which is driving up demand, further pushing other local automobile companies to import electric variations of their automobiles. In Kathmandu, even some public buses are now zero-emission and electric. Further advancements in technology have also pushed electric motors to be more effective while also implementing digital technologies to help monitor and assist drivers. The cost of batteries is also going down by the year making electric vehicles more affordable, while also providing drivers more reach per charge. As prices come down, electric vehicles should be more affordable for Nepali customers as well and with big companies like Tesla constantly pushing for developments in technology, electronic vehicles should only get better in 2020. Bezel-less and Foldable Smartphone design Bezel-less displays turned into a norm in 2019. Almost all smartphones tout edge-to-edge displays and even premium laptops and televisions have bezel-less displays. Dell’s new XPS line is one of the most famous bezel-less laptops while companies like Razer and Lenovo have also further pushed the move to sleeker bezel-less screen designs. In the smartphone space, even lower- to mid-ranged devices tout bezel-less designs with front camera cutouts, while companies like Oppo and Xiaomi have already prototyped displays with an invisible front-facing camera inside the display. A long way from 2018’s notched displays, truly bezel-less screens became more of a reality in 2019 with 2020 seemingly pushing this concept further.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2019/12/31/a-look-back-at-2019-s-tech

176,"Learning one’s cultural roots, one level at a time","December 10, 2019","Every time the Nepali community came together to celebrate festivals in London, it was always a challenge to engage the children in the revelry. Caught between western society ideals they are being raised in and their Nepali cultural roots, the children, their parents, and even event organisers were in a quandary: they didn’t know how to bridge the gap between the two cultures.  That was when Sanyukta Shrestha, who is the president of Pasa Puchah Guthi, a cultural community established to fulfil the needs of the Newar community in the UK, and a game developer, came up with a solution. He created Yomariman, a PC game, and encouraged children to play it. He launched the game last year, during one such community event, when Nepali families gathered to celebrate Yomari Puhni.  Yomari Puhni is a Newar festival celebrated on the first full moon day of December by making, eating and distributing yomaris, steamed cone-shaped dumplings made with rice flour stuffed with sweet fillings or even meat. Shrestha says he thought it would be apt to launch his game during the festival’s celebration as he saw that children were fond of yomari. By basing the game on yomaris, Shrestha hoped children would become acquainted with their culture in an interesting and engaging way. “Most of the time the children don’t know what’s going on during these events. They just sit in a corner,” says Shrestha. With the game, he thought he could reach out to the children better. “For us to engage children with the events, or with their cultural roots, it is important that we speak their language,” he says.  Yomariman is a simple game for children of all ages. In the first part of the game, the player is taught how to make a yomari. They are given ingredients on screen and have to choose the right items in the right order. The other part of the game includes the journey of Yomariman, a superhero who collects yomaris for points. “The children don’t have to do much. Just click on the yomaris approaching Yomariman and consume them,” says Shrestha.  Once the children were well-versed in the game, they were then shown how to make the dish in real life.  “As they had already learnt it on the game, they didn’t have trouble making it. Most did a good job,” says the game developer, who also participated in the yomari-making session. “The children looked happy as did their parents.”  But the game didn’t just end there. As the players ate the yomaris, they receive ‘guthi points’. And because the game is mostly targeted to children, it has a twist in the end: players are asked moral questions before all their guthi points are added up.  “The game asks what the players would do with the guthi points. The options are: buy things or give it to charity,” says Shrestha. “The answers that take social welfare into account get more points.”",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2019/12/10/learning-one-s-cultural-roots-one-level-at-a-time
177,Here are five indie games you need to play,"December 3, 2019","AAA gaming has become surprisingly formulaic over the years. Many different games produced by vastly different creative teams and developers feel more and more similar to each other than ever before. Big gaming companies also seem to be more comfortable rehashing established franchises like Call of Duty and Battlefield rather than experimenting and focusing more on creating unique gaming experiences.  Smaller independent gaming companies, however, have been producing games that come as a breath of fresh air. While these smaller gaming companies might not be able to compete with big gaming studios in terms of budget, they have managed to, in many ways, surpass many mainstream games in terms of quality, inventiveness and gameplay.

178,What does cloud-based gaming mean for Nepali players?,"November 19, 2019","A lot of the data that we consume today lives on the cloud. Everything—from videos, music and even software—is delivered effectively through the internet, and in many ways online connectivity has improved the way we consume and produce content. Applications like Google Docs have excellent collaborative features, while social interaction through likes and comments on social media platforms has pushed interactivity even in areas of static content consumption.  Likewise, online servers have also become home for games, with many gamers streaming their gameplay online for a community of online viewers. Traditionally, all of these games have been rendered on localised hardware such as gaming consoles or PCs, but in recent years, companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are working towards making cloud gaming a reality. Google’s Stadia aims to make gaming consoles and PCs obsolete by offshoring all of the horsepower needed to render games to their servers and sending gamers the rendered frames through the internet. Rendered images would then be streamed to a gamer’s display device and interactively respond to user controls, much like an interactive video but with split-second response times. With the release of cloud gaming services like Stadia, gaming consoles, game disks and even game downloads should be a thing of the past. Cloud gaming, however, is not a very new concept. Companies like G-Cluster have experimented and demonstrated cloud gaming to varying levels of success since the 2000s. Due to technical drawbacks, however, many of these services never came to fruition. But with many big tech companies releasing or experimenting with cloud gaming today, it seems that the internet infrastructure is finally capable enough to handle streaming of games. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Electronic Arts are already experimenting with cloud gaming with Google leading as its front-runner with Stadia, mainly because of Google’s existing network infrastructure. Currently, Stadia is in a pre-release bundle that comes with a Stadia controller, Chromecast Ultra and a three-months of Stadia Pro subscription for $130. A more complete release is expected in 2020 with 42 initial games on the platform, with a monthly subscription rate of $10. The $10 per month is only for Stadia subscription, however, and gamers will have to pay separately for the games they want to play on the platform. Microsoft’s Project xCloud is inciting hype amongst gamers since Microsoft has access to a larger collection of games through their Xbox library, but the release date of xCloud is yet to be announced. Similarly, Nvidia’s GeForce Now is already active and has even expanded to various countries like Russia as part of their GeForce Now Alliance. While a lot of big-name players are experimenting with cloud gaming, what does it mean for its consumers? Well, I’d say, cloud gaming comes with benefits for them. With a successful implementation of the service, gamers won’t have to invest in expensive gaming hardware anymore, making gaming more accessible. Cross-device support would become a reality since all gaming data would be hosted online and any kind of device with a screen and an internet connection would be capable of running even the most demanding of games. Currently, Google Stadia is scheduled for release with titles such as Cyberpunk 2077, Borderlands 3 and Rise of the Tomb Raider, all very demanding games. The only problem would be a poor internet connection. These services not just demand higher download speeds but also require very low latency (denoted by pings), as well as the fact, consume high amounts of data. For internet users on a data plan, services like Stadia might be too demanding on their data caps.  In Nepal, even as internet speeds keep growing, the problem of data caps and latency will still be an issue even if gamers manage to get a subscription internationally. Locally, getting games to run on lower-end devices would come as a boon for gamers investing heavily in their gaming. But even gaining access to a Stadia subscription might be difficult for Nepalis due to a lack of international payment portals, and getting a friend or relative abroad to commit to a subscription might be the only option for local gamers.  Microsoft’s focus on India with their xCloud service may also open up new avenues for Nepali gamers to access the service. The high bandwidth internet connection still remains a problem, but considering that internet speeds are getting faster locally, they might reach a point of Stadia support by the time it’s publically released in 2020.  Subscription-based services come with their own share of problems as well, mainly the problem of never truly owning the games you pay for. Recently, people in Venezuela who had subscribed for Adobe’s Creative Cloud service were denied services because of updated US policies, making it impossible for Venezuelan creatives to access the software that they had paid for. This rings true even for subscription-based gaming services like Stadia, where a dependency on a third-party would mean a revocation of all rights to access games that users had paid for in the past. This dependency could even push service providers to implement higher service costs that gamers would have to adhere to since their gaming library would be associated with one specific service. And service costs will go higher to reflect maintenance and upgrade costs as these services start gaining momentum.",Science & Technology,https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2019/11/19/what-does-cloud-based-gaming-mean-for-nepali-players
179,A Nepali animator’s guide of must-have applications,"November 12, 2019","Prashant Anand Gopali decided he wanted to pursue making 3D animation when he met a recent Animation and Filmmaking graduate from Florida, USA. The acquaintance was the one who first introduced him to the craft. That was seven years ago.  Today, as founder and creator of Greywind Productions, a studio that puts out audio, video, graphics, VFX and animation content, Gopali is a full-time VFX artist and 3D animator. The 23-year-old founded his production company in 2016 and is best known for the short film Shattered with Elyzian Studios, released in 2017. The video currently has over 5,000 views on his YouTube channel. Currently, he is also working as the creative head at Evince Studios, another studio that produces audio, video, animation and VFX content.  “I was very intrigued by how animation could be used for storytelling,” says Gopali. “But I didn’t have the means like my friend to learn it from an international university, so obviously I had to improvise.” He adds that it was a continuous process of learning and refining that has made him more comfortable with his craft. Since there weren’t many people who understood the scope of animation then, Gopali’s first teacher or instructor was the internet. He spent many hours going through YouTube tutorials to learn 3D animation and VFX art. But he knew that wouldn’t be enough. So, in 2015, he enrolled in Islington College, Kathmandu, from where he completed Bsc in Multimedia Technologies to get a formal education on something he was passionate about.  Gopali shares his five most preferred software to create 3D animations.
