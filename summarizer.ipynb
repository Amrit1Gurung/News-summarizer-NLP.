The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security says that the programme generated employment opportunities for its target of 60,ooo people across the country in the fiscal year 2019-20.  Besides, the Labour Ministry has also received a soft loan of approximately Rs14 billion from the World Bank to implement the Youth Employment Transformation Initiative Project, a five-year project, under the employment programme. ”  Two years into its implementation, the Prime Minister Employment Programme, which promises a minimum 100 days of employment for unemployed registered citizens, have not shown promising results.  Purna Chandra Bhattarai, a former labour secretary, said the programme, despite promising a minimum 100 days of employment, has not been able to provide jobs for 50 days   \n",

According to Som Prasad Lamichhane, director with the Pravasi Nepali Coordination Committee, an organisation working for the rights of Nepali migrant workers, Nepal government could have taken a diplomatic initiative to waive off the overstay fines of migrant workers.  The UAE government’s ongoing amnesty programme for foreigners, including Nepali migrants, have given a three-month grace period to the foreigners whose visa expired before March 1, meaning they have until November to return to their countries without facing any punishments or fines for overstaying their visas.  “The UAE government had approached the Nepal government about sending back Nepali workers on free flights, but the Nepal government did not even give the landing permission,” Sherpa said.   According to Pasang Sherpa, vice-chairman of Non-Resident Nepalese Association (NRNA), UAE chapter, overstay fines are being charged only to those workers boarding their flights via Dubai airport as different emirates have different rules  \n",

The Supreme Court on June 15 ordered the government to repatriate the Nepali migrant workers stranded in various labour destinations by using the Foreign Employment Welfare Fund.  He argues the guidelines simply instruct the Nepali missions to contact the employers, recruiting agencies, or the host governments and check if the workers are getting any financial support for airfare so that they could return home.   Shom Prasad Luitel, lawyer who had filed the petition at the Supreme Court for repatriation of Nepali migrant workers, says the government and its embassies in labour hosting countries are not committed to the task of repatriating the stranded citizens.   Din Bandhu Subedi, spokesperson for the Foreign Employment Board, which manages the welfare fund, said the board had released Rs 4 million to the Nepal Embassy in Malaysia to send back 86 stranded workers  \n",

After the 2015 constitution ensured Nepal as a federal democratic republic, elections held in 2017 installed three tiers of government across the country–a federal government in Kathmandu, seven provincial governments and 753 local governments.  “I do not see any point in ministers and leaders from Kathmandu making rounds of every other disaster-hit areas, as provincial and local governments are already in place to respond to such events” said Khimlal Devkota, an expert on federal affairs who also writes extensively on fiscal federalism.  The federal government is already facing criticism for holding on to the concept of chief district officers and making them work as the Home Ministry’s liaison in the districts even in the current federal set-up.  While there is a worldwide practice of prime ministers or presidents visiting the places hit by a disaster or crisis of a large scale, such events are largely meant to instill the feeling into the citizens that the state is there to support them  \n",
